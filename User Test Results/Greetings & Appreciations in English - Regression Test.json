We have two sports clubs that you might find interesting: METU COUPLE DANCE COMMUNITY (EDT) and ODT\u00dc SAS (SU ALTI SPORLARI TOPLULU\u011eU). Both clubs are popular among students, but they have different focuses. \n\n          METU COUPLE DANCE COMMUNITY (EDT) is more focused on dance and cultural events, while ODT\u00dc SAS is focused on underwater sports. If you're interested in dance or cultural events, EDT might be the better choice. If you're interested in underwater sports, ODT\u00dc SAS is the way to go! Both clubs have their own unique events and activities throughout the year, so you can check them out to see which one you'd like to join. Would you like to know more about either of these clubs or is there something else I can help you with?\u201d \n\n        Note: The answer is concise, friendly, and prioritizes the most relevant information. It also invites the user to ask more questions or explore the clubs further."
