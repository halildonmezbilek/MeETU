If you don't have an English exam score, there are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Take an English proficiency test**: You can take one of the following tests to demonstrate your English skills:\n\t* TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)\n\t* IELTS (International English Language Testing System)\n\t* PTE (Pearson Test of English)\n\t* METU also accepts other English language proficiency tests, so be sure to check their website for the most up-to-date information.\n2. **Apply for an English preparatory program**: If you don't meet the English proficiency requirements, you can apply for an English preparatory program at METU. This will give you a chance to improve your English skills before starting your undergraduate or graduate studies.\n3. **Contact METU's admissions office**: Reach out to METU's admissions office directly and ask about their specific requirements and options for international students without English exam scores. They may be able to provide more information on alternative pathways or exemptions.\n\nRemember, it's essential to check the specific requirements for your desired program and department at METU.

You're not required to submit a score at the time of application. \n\nHowever, once you're admitted and register for classes, it's essential to note that you'll need to provide a valid TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE ACADEMIC score. If you fail to do so, you can take METU's own English Proficiency Exam.\n\nBut here's the important part: if you don't submit a valid English proficiency exam result during registration and don't pass the ODT\u00dc English Proficiency Exam, you'll be required to attend the English Preparatory Class at the Department of Basic English for one year. This class is designed to help you improve your English skills before starting your undergraduate courses.\n\nTo avoid this, it's highly recommended that you submit a valid English proficiency exam result (TOEFL, IELTS, or ODT\u00dc English Proficiency Exam) during registration. If you do so, you'll be exempt from the English Preparatory Class and can directly start your undergraduate studies.\n\nSo, to summarize: if you're an international student without an English exam score, focus on submitting a valid score during registration to avoid any potential issues!",
