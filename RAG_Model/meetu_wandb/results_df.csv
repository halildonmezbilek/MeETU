Besides, there also are ring busses that operate between dormitories and departments.\n']"," The operating hours for transportation at METU are generally from early morning until late evening, with some variations depending on the specific mode of transport. For instance, buses operate from around 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM, while the metro system operates from 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM. However, it's always a good idea to check the official METU transportation website or mobile app for the most accurate and up-to-date schedules. Keep in mind that these hours may change during holidays or semester breaks.

         Mobility significantly impacts routing protocols in mobile networks, such as cellular networks. As devices move, their connections to the network may change, which can lead to disruptions in communication. To address this, routing protocols in mobile networks often employ techniques like handoff, where the device's connection is seamlessly transferred from one cell to another as the device moves. This helps maintain continuous communication even as the device moves.

         In terms of impact, mobility can lead to increased network complexity, as devices may move in and out of coverage areas, requiring the network to adapt constantly. This can also lead to challenges in terms of resource allocation, as the network must balance the needs of mobile devices with the available bandwidth and battery life.

         In the context of data transfer, mobility can introduce additional challenges, such as packet loss due to handoff or network congestion caused by high device density in certain areas. To address these challenges, various protocols have been developed for reliable data transfer over unreliable channels, congestion control, and flow control. These protocols can be implemented in either the user or kernel space of operating systems at the transport layer.

It concentrates on the functional, structural, cultural and geographical factors that led to the emergence and development of specific architectural products in these times and geographies. ']"," The Renaissance period had a significant influence on the conservation and adaptive reuse of cultural heritage sites, particularly in terms of architectural forms and technologies. During the Renaissance, there was a renewed interest in classical Greek and Roman architecture, which led to the revival and adaptation of these architectural styles in various cultural heritage sites.

         For instance, the Renaissance architects like Brunelleschi, Alberti, and Bramante, drew inspiration from the classical Roman architectural forms, such as the dome, the arch, and the colonnade, and incorporated them into their designs for churches, palaces, and public buildings. This fusion of old and new architectural styles became a hallmark of the Renaissance period and can be seen in many cultural heritage sites across Europe and beyond.

         In terms of technologies, the Renaissance period also saw the development of new construction techniques, such as the use of iron for reinforcement, the invention of the flying buttress, and the use of perspective in architectural design. These technologies were applied to the conservation and adaptive reuse of cultural heritage sites, allowing for the preservation and restoration of damaged structures, as well as the creation of new buildings that were both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

         Today, the principles and practices of the Renaissance period continue to inform the conservation and adaptive reuse of cultural heritage sites. For example, the use of classical architectural forms and the application of new technologies are still common in the restoration of historical buildings and monuments. Additionally, the Renaissance emphasis on the importance of aesthetics, as well as the social, cultural, and historical values associated with cultural heritage sites, continues to guide conservation efforts today.

         At METU, you can study the conservation and adaptive reuse of cultural heritage sites in the ARCH482 course offered by the Department of Architecture.

It is characterized by a rejection of the belief that design should be purely functional and devoid of ornamentation, and a return to the use of symbolic and decorative elements.

        In terms of cultural heritage, post-modernism often incorporates elements from various historical periods and styles, reflecting a sense of eclecticism and a rejection of the idea that a single, unified style is necessary or desirable. This can be seen as a response to the homogenization of global culture, and an attempt to preserve and celebrate cultural diversity.

']"," As a Cultural Heritage Preservation Specialist, understanding the architectural movements of the 20th century, particularly modernism and post-modernism, can significantly inform our approach to the conservation and adaptive reuse of cultural heritage sites, especially in urban contexts like Ankara.

         Modernism, characterized by its emphasis on functionality, simplicity, and the use of new materials and technologies, can provide insights into the efficient and sustainable reuse of heritage buildings. For instance, modernist principles can guide the removal of non-essential elements, the adaptation of structures for contemporary uses, and the integration of modern technologies to enhance the functionality of heritage sites.

         Post-modernism, on the other hand, with its focus on eclecticism, irony, and the rejection of absolute truth, can encourage a more flexible and creative approach to the conservation of heritage sites. This can involve the incorporation of contemporary elements, the use of irony and humor to engage visitors, and the celebration of diversity and complexity in the urban fabric.

         In the context of Ankara, these principles can be applied to the adaptive reuse of historical buildings, such as the Ankara Castle or the Atatürk Mansion, while preserving their historical integrity. For example, the castle could be transformed into a museum or cultural center, while maintaining its original architectural features. The Atatürk Mansion, on the other hand, could be adapted to serve as a modern art gallery, while incorporating contemporary design elements that complement its historical architecture.

         Furthermore, understanding the history of a city like Ankara is crucial in the formation of its current cultural characteristics. The city's architectural landscape, influenced by various civilizations throughout history, reflects its rich cultural heritage. By preserving and reusing these historical buildings, we not only maintain the city's cultural identity but also contribute to its continued evolution and development.

         In conclusion, the principles of modernism and post-modernism can provide valuable guidance in the conservation and adaptive reuse of cultural heritage sites in urban contexts like Ankara. By combining historical preservation with contemporary design, we can create a city culture that is both rooted in its past and forward-looking.","The architectural movements of the 20th century, particularly modernism and post-modernism, provide critical insights for the conservation and adaptive reuse of cultural heritage sites. Modernism, with its emphasis on functionality and simplicity, encourages a focus on the essential qualities of a building, which can guide preservation efforts to maintain the integrity of historical structures while accommodating contemporary needs. Post-modernism, on the other hand, introduces a dialogue between old and new, advocating for a more contextual approach that respects historical narratives while allowing for innovative adaptations. In urban contexts like Ankara, where the course ARCH403 emphasizes documenting modern architectural heritage, these movements can inform strategies that balance preservation with modern development. By applying research and survey methods, as outlined in the course objectives, we can develop a nuanced understanding of the architectural heritage, ensuring that conservation efforts are both respectful of the past and responsive to current urban dynamics.",1.0,0.0,0.48,0.5769230769230769,0.9565568426750637

Web caching is an efficient method of saving time and easing the burden on the network traffic by keeping\xa0 temporary copies of web objects requested by the user (desirable to accessed later to the same remote web sources -such as the data that are accessible via protocols such as HTTP, FTP, Gopher-) on one of the servers of the local area network, where these previously cached objects are instantly returned to the user. so, the average time for returning the requests of users using the same web caching server is reduced and more bandwidth is gained. \xa0  \nFAQ Link: https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/what-webcache\n']"," Web caching is a technique used to improve the performance of web applications by storing copies of frequently accessed web pages or resources in a cache, which is a temporary storage area. When a user requests a web page, the cache checks if it has a copy of the requested page. If it does, the cache returns the copy to the user, reducing the time it takes to retrieve the page from the original server. This process is known as serving a cached object.

         The benefits of web caching include:

         1. Reduced network traffic: By serving cached objects, web caching reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the network, which helps to conserve bandwidth and reduce network congestion.

         2. Faster page load times: Since cached objects are stored locally, they can be served more quickly than objects that need to be retrieved from a remote server. This results in faster page load times for users, improving their overall web browsing experience.

         3. Improved scalability: Web caching allows web servers to handle a larger number of requests by offloading some of the work to caches. This helps to improve the scalability of web applications and makes them more resilient to high traffic loads.

         4. Reduced server load: By serving cached objects, web caching reduces the load on web servers, which helps to improve their overall performance and availability.

         5. Cost savings: Web caching can help to reduce the cost of running web applications by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the network and by reducing the load on web servers.

         In summary, web caching is an important technique for managing network traffic and improving user access to web resources. By storing frequently accessed web pages or resources in a cache, web caching can help to reduce network traffic, improve page load times, improve scalability, reduce server load, and save costs.","Web caching is an efficient method of saving time and easing the burden on network traffic by keeping temporary copies of web objects requested by the user. This is particularly useful for accessing the same remote web sources, such as data accessible via protocols like HTTP, FTP, and Gopher. By storing these previously cached objects on one of the servers of the local area network, they can be instantly returned to the user. This process reduces the average time for returning requests from users using the same web caching server and results in more bandwidth being gained.",0.5,0.0,0.88,1.0,0.9307379157149942
