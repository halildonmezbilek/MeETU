Regarding the quality of our dormitory services, the inspections carried out in 2021 in accordance with the TSE-EN ISO 9001:2015 standards were completed with success.
The services provided by our unit are carried out according to the procedures, instructions, duties, and responsibilities determined within the Dormitory Regulations, Student Discipline Regulations of the higher education institutions, decisions taken by the Executive Board of Dormitories, and the certificates of quality.
Therefore, every year, the Executive Board of Dormitories evaluates the dormitory applications of students based on the current capacity of dormitories, the number of applications, and the conditions for staying in the dormitories established in accordance with the aforementioned regulations and approved by the Rectorate. Then, the registration procedures of the students whose applications are accepted are conducted.
We endeavor to provide 24/7 uninterrupted service that includes an environment of respect, love, equality and trust in our dormitories with an understanding that prioritizes a service that is high-quality, transparent, modern but at the same time adherent to the traditions of METU, which can only be achieved with a team spirit.

Facilities in the Dormitories: There is a mini-fridge in each room. For each student, a studying desk, a chair, a closet for clothes, and a closet for shoes are provided in each room. In addition, the dormitory offers students a bedding set consisting of bed sheet, blanket and pillow. Students can also bring and use their own bedding sets if they prefer to do so (but in this case, washing and cleaning these bedding sets will be their responsibility). In our dormitories, there are common studying rooms, TV rooms, laundry rooms, and kitchens as well as another common room for students of the Department of Architecture so that they can carry out their activities such as drawing. A sufficient number of automatic washing machines, dryers, irons, and ironing boards are available to students in the laundry rooms.
The bedding sets in the room are changed periodically, but if need be, they can be changed outside their regular cycle as well. These bedding sets are washed and ironed in the laundry room, where industrial washing machines are used. There is hot water in our dormitories ready for use 24/7.
