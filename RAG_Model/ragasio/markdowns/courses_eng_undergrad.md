ARCH322: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE. No objective 
Focusing on the major movements and artists of the post-war period, this course allows students to learn methods, tools, and terminologies to critically analyze contemporary art in relation to social and historical context, critical debates, new media, and the changing role of the spectator/participant. Not only does the art production postdating World War II raise the questions of what art is or can be, but it is also concerned with endless possible ways in which the audiences can experience art. Contemporary art employs a range of new materials and technologies, questions the validity of intentionality and authorship, and addresses previously excluded audiences. It invades non-art spaces, blurs the boundaries between text and image, document and performance, asks questions about institutional frames (the museum, gallery, and art journal), and generates new forms of criticism. Much of the canon of what counts as important is still in flux, especially for the last twenty years. And the stage is no longer centered only on the United States and Europe but is becoming increasingly global.

ARCH491: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE. ARCH 491 “Landscape Research I” course aims to develop a general appreciation and knowledge on landscape issues by introducing increasing interaction of landscape design with urbanism, architecture, and art.  The course intends to reveal landscape as a natural, cultural, and aesthetic phenomenon; not only as a technical issue.  By examining a range of precedent projects in different contexts and scales, the course will discuss the extended field of landscape architecture to inspire students from architecture, urban planning, and design disciplines who intend further specialization in the area of landscape architecture and design.
The course is composed of a series of lectures and a research period.  Lecture series are assembled under two headings: On “Landscape” and Expanded Field of “Landscape”.  On “Landscape”, the first module of the course elaborates the meaning, language, and milieu of the landscape on a conceptual basis. This part ends with students' presentation on a selected article from the assigned reading list on the landscape.  The second module, Expanded Field of “Landscape”, discusses the inspiring and generative interplay between landscape and art, architecture, urbanism. The knowledge gained from both modules will be reflected through a landscape excursion required to be documented through a critical narration.
 
The main aim of this course is to present a general layout of landscape architecture. Besides, the methodology of planning of urban areas, national parks, recreation centers, sport areas, highways, are the usual subjects of this course. Erosion control, both living and non-living materials and their characteristics and standards are also presented.

ARCH492: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE. In the past two decades, the subject of landscape went under a fertile interrogation within design culture. This laid the latent capacity of the field to embrace a wide array of issues of the urban milieu bare. Among these, the field’s promise in addressing matters of infrastructure is remarkable. This is a radical challenge into infrastructure’s earlier preconception as a closed subject matter of engineering. Such a confrontation opens the round table for discussions around the nature of contemporary urbanization which renders systems of production and those of consumption remote. Injecting into this ground, this course dwells on systems of food – patterns of production, distribution, consumption and disposal. Touching upon issues ranging from gastronomic traditions to emergent food cultures, from (bio)politics to health, it aims to picture the breadth of the issue making room for (your) in-depth scrutiny into specific spatially momentous dimensions of the theme. 
 
The course is composed of a series of lectures and research period. Lecture series are assembled under two headings: On Landscape and Expanded Field of Landscape. First module of the course, On Landscape, elaborates the meaning, language and milieu of landscape on a conceptual basis. This part ends up with students presentation on a selected article from the assigned reading list on landscape. The second module, Expanded Field of Landscape, discusses the inspiring and generative interplay between landscape and art, architecture, urbanism.

CRP201: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF CITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING. The aim of the CRP 201 Planning Studio is to give tudent the ability to create relationship between function and structure, and establish the material basis of a sustainable socio-ecological development model. This encompasses: 
- production of the structure (program, relationships, usage, with sustainability criteria)
- establishing the relationship between structures (spatial proximity, accesibility, transportation, privacy)
- bringing together different functional systems (urban design project with model)
 
The planning studio course is structured to give students a comprehensive understanding of the part-whole relationship through induction. To achieve this, students are expected to develop the relationship between form and function through
?_x0001_Creating a structure, incorporating a specific program and integration within the parcel;
?_x0001_Establishing the relationship between structures, considering factors such as spatial proximity, accessibility, transportation, and privacy;
?_x0001_Integrating different structural systems, involving an urban design project at a 1/2000 scale along with a model at a 1/500 scale.
By the end of the course, students will have a thorough understanding of the complex relationships within a small part öf the city, starting from a single functional structure and expanding to a network of structures interacting through varied functions. The understanding of scale relationships will evolve from concrete to abstract, setting the groundwork for Planning Studio IV. As a sub task the 5tudio aims to establish the basis of a sustainable socio-ecological development model, Each analysis and design stage is enriched by the sustainability perspective to contribute to the production of sustainable urban structures from parts to whole.

CRP202: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF CITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING. Following our commitment to reach the whole through parts the studio is following the principles set in Planning Studio III. We are moving from neighbourhood to group of neighbourhoods and than to districts. 1/5000 scale can define this best as a starting point. When we advance further we start to cover  BatÄ±kent District with its relationship to urban macroform. We investigate inter urban, intra urban and urban rural relationships. 1/25.000 scale plan fits well to discover such relationships. At the final stage we will position BatÄ±eknt in a much wider context. While discussions will focus on reginal, national and international relationships their reflection on Ankara and BatÄ±kent will define our concentration point. We will utilise schematical represeentational techniques to respond requirements of spatial strategic plan. 
 
 
The planning studio course continues to explore part-whole relationship, extending from neighbourhood scale to the urban-regional scale, building upon the foundations set in Planning Studio III. It begins with the development of 1/5000 scale plans covering a broader part of the city. Students start to deal with a different abstraction level by moving from structures to land-uses. Central to the course is the interplay between land-uses and the transportation system that links them, Throughout the planning process, decisions are made based on policies and are realized through spatial strategies and implementation opportunities, Students will learn to:
Develop decisions based on relationship with different land-uses;
Utilise varying abstraction levels appropriate to each scale;
Conduct spatial analysis using written and numerical data;
Formulate visions, policies, strategies, and targets, and spatially represent them on urban development plans.

Food is our fuel for existence and the symbolic center of our lives. Food is not only a bare necessity, it is also the medium through which knowledge, tradition and even history are transmitted, known and shared by all. The concept of ?foodscapes? emerged in the 1990s within the context of studies of social and spatial inequalities in public health and food systems. Since then, it has incorporated the study of the entire chain of food from its production to consumption especially in the context of changing notions of landscape and space. This course intends to introduce the term 'foodscape' as a part of urban studies. The term and its connotations will be explored through various aspects of urban and rural life; it is not just a material space, but includes socio-political processes. The course aims to investigate how food shapes and is shaped by the spatial characteristics of urban and rural environments, considering the historical, cultural, and socio-economic factors that contribute to the diversity of food experiences in places. Different approaches, such as analytical, systematical, or phenomenological, will be explored to develop a holistic spatial approach to urban and rural foodscapes. Each week, examples from around the world will be presented around specific themes to enrich the understanding of general concepts.
Throughout the course, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the spatial intricacies that define a city's culinary identity. The course encourages a critical examination of the role of food in shaping the urban experience whereby the students will critically analyze the spatial dimensions of urban foodscapes, gaining insights into the interconnectedness of feasting, market spaces, and broader spatial dynamics that shape the culinary landscapes of cities.

## Entry 170

ID221: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGN. This course is designed as a must course for the second-year industrial design students. The course aims to make a survey of the development of design practice in production sector and the outline of the transformation of production system from the mid-18th century pre-industrialization period also focusing on the earlier craft production system, and the following industrialization period, then the development of industrial design during modernization period to today. Following the early periods, it is indispensable to focus on modernism and the modernist assumptions/understanding/teachings behind design and industrial design, so to make a survey of modern design and industrial design to identify/understand/reflect upon the theoretical underpinnings of modernism in the practical and theoretical aspects of design and industrial design. The main objective of the course is to develop a critical perspective on the historical transformation, concepts and significant issues related to the development of modern design and industrial design. Particularly, change, transition and transformation occupy the agenda of the course as formative concepts; for the social, cultural and economic domains have undergone a considerable transformation and change within the changing economic, social and production relations through the course of the 19th century industrial revolution and the following 20th century capitalist system. The early 20th century developments opened a niche for the emergence of “industrial design” as a recognized profession when it has become an indispensable part of industrial; later post-industrial, socio-technological and consumer culture in the West. Furthermore, this situation has been gradually becoming similar for Turkey. As a candidate industrial designer, to reflect upon these issues will eventually and hopefully help to place the role of oneself generally within the technological and consumer culture of today’s system of industrial, economic and social relations.
 
Covers the period from industrialization (from the mid 18th century toward the end of the 19th century) to the years between two world wars. Focuses on the developments which led to the emergence of industrial design as a separate profession by developing an overall perspective on concepts and prominent issues related to design and industrial design. Aims to enable students to understand the events, issues and concepts that are significant for the historical transformation of production, production relations and transformation of design. Aims to enable students to develop a critical perspective on the theoretical and professional aspects of design and industrial design.

ARCH415: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE. The course aims to acquaint students with urban design within a discourse of sustainability. As residential areas constitute the major percentage of land coverage in urban areas, their design becomes a critical issue in terms of economic resources, ecological constraints; and above all, the possibility of the social construction of space (social sustainability) needs to be studied with expectations of achieving better communities for confronting urban life. Urban design is expected to facilitate a holistic design of the environment in lieu of acclaimed restraints, rather than the “green design” of the single building, which has invaded the scene in terms of sustainability. Case studies  surface issues for further delibration in terms of urban sustainability.
 
Studies the techniques of site planning in four parts. Starts with an analysis of the main physical site elements, continues with the analysis, relation and location of activities on a site. Alternative choices for vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems are studied in the third section. The architectural design elements of site design, criteria for the evaluation of good site design, and practical know-how on site design constitute the fourth section.

## Entry 624

PHYS400: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS. In PHYS 400 you are given the opportunity to study a problem important in Physics and important to the instructor which you have chosen to work with.  Your instructor is your mentor, and he/she will guide you in reporting on the problem effectively. Upon completion of this course you will experience what it means to do research in Physics, write a concise scientific report/paper, and present your work to a committee of physicists. Not all problems and work done towards investigating that problem is equal. However, all are important. And what is most important is that you enjoy the subject matter of the problem you are working on. This course does not expect you to solve a new problem and it does not expect for you to become an expert on that problem, what is expected of you is that you understand the problem and are able to explain it to others both in your presentation and report/paper. Some students end up publishing their investigation in a scientific journal, while others continue to work with their instructor at the completion of this course towards this goal. And some others use the experience gained in this course to look for jobs.  PHYS 400 is the first and only time you are given a chance to work independently in Physics. You are given a rare opportunity to show your skill and commitment as a young physicist.
 
One-term short research project to give practical experience.

PHIL110: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. No objective 
This course aims to introduce students to the most important concepts and problems of the main branches of philosophy from a systematical-rather than a historical- point of view. It starts with the question of what philosophy is. The answer to this question lies in finding a criterion by means of which philosophy can be differentiated from science and various other human activities. The rest of the course discusses the following basic topics. Validity of arguments (logic), the nature of truth and knowledge (epistemology), the fundamental categories of being (ontology), the meaning of linguistic expressions (philosophy of language), scientific concepts and theories (philosophy of science), the distinction between morally good and bad (ethics), and, finally beauty in nature and value of artworks (aesthetics).

PHIL201: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. This course offers an introductory survey to various ethical theories within the history of western philosophy, including virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, social contract theory, feminist ethics, and existentialist ethics. Bringing these ethical frameworks to bear on contemporary ethical issues, this course seeks to combine theoretical and applied approaches to ethics. Beginning with the question of “the good life,” we shall ask: Why live ethically? And how to live ethically? Tracing how each philosopher with whom we engage responds to these questions, the students are expected to develop an understanding of different kinds of ethical reasoning, which in turn would enable them to analyze issues and propose an informed, intelligent response. As their final project, the students will write a paper in which they take up a specific ethical problem (e.g. capital punishment, suicide, prostitution, torture, hunger strike, pornography, etc.) and argue for a position by utilizing and building on the kinds of ethical reasoning we traced and scrutinized throughout the semester.

PHIL204: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. A note about who can take the course:  This PHIL undergraduate course is open to Philosophy students only.  I am unable to admit non-Philosophy students during normal registration week.  If, however, some people drop the course in the following week, I may admit a few more students to the course.  If you want to be considered during the add-drop period, send me an e-mail before it explaining your background.
COURSE DESCRIPTION:
     "ΓΝΩΘΙ ΣΕΑΥΤΟΝ"
     (Inscription at Apollo’s Temple at Delphi)
This course is intended to be the second part of a general introduction to theory of knowledge. Although I will assume in my lectures a basic philosophical background and some familiarity with epistemological notions (as provided, for instance, by PHIL-106), the course can in principle be taken independently --i.e., without previously taking PHIL-106.
In this course, we will cover some historical material as well as readings from contemporary epistemology literature.  The course will have three main philosophical/discursive axes: (1) Epistemology of Perception, (2) Theories of Justification, and finally (3) Feminist Epistemology.  In dealing with (2) above, emphasis will be placed especially on the debate between foundationalism and coherentism.  And we will study part (3) as an example of the contemporary reaction to traditional analytic epistemology.
Grading:  Students will write two in-class examinations: (1) The mid-term exam will probably take place in April (40% grade value); (2) The remaining part of your total grade will come from the final exam (60% grade value).  Please note that if you take only one of those two exams, you will get an ‘F’ grade.
 
Common-sense knowledge and scientific knowledge. The growth of knowledge; rationality and progress.

PHIL208: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. At the end of this course, students will have learned,
some challenges to human morality (amoralism, theism, relativism) and how to deal with them,
the basic concepts of metaethic (realism, subjectivism, intrinsic value),
the fundamental theories of normative ethics (consequentialism, virtue ethics, deontological/Kantian ethics),
the basic concepts of and problems in environmental ethics (speciesism, rights of animals, anthropocentrism, biocentrism, ecocentrism)
 
Environmental ethics is a crucial as well as a controversial area of applied ethics that approaches normative issues and principles related with human intervention with the natural environment. It is crucial for the guidance of individuals, corporations, and governments in determining the principles affecting their policies, lifestyles, and actions across the entire range of environmental issues. It is controversial for the complexity of environment, conflict of interest in environment, and human centered ethical traditions, concepts and theories neglecting non-human environment. So while uncertainty and conflict of interest increase the demands on ethical principles, the basic assumptions of traditional ethics are difficult to extend to the non-human environment. Environmental ethics must also be a theoretical field of ethics to deal, for example, with the following problems. People have rights, but do other (higher) animals? Do plants even have interests? Can only individuals deserve to be subject for moral considerations or can group of individuals, such as species and ecosystem also? These and similar questions are treated by both anthropocentrists and ecocentrists.

This course is an inquiry into the role of emotion in a rational life. As an introductory course, it requires no pre-knowledge of philosophy. It tries to explore the role that emotion plays in the acquisition of  beliefs and desires, the relation between them, and their transformation into actions and policies. It studies also emotions considered as a component of life and experience and investigate whether they may themselves be subject to rational assessment. For this purpose it goes to the historical roots of the problem of emotions, e.g. what role does it play in our life? What is an emotion? These questions are important in the philosophy of mind and ethics. Philosophers have not always despised the importance of emotions. Hume, for example, claimed that reason is and ought to be, the slave of passion. Nietzsche, on the other hand, insisted that emotion and reason are not really opposite but complementary to each other. In this course, the claims of important philosophers are discussed and moral, aesthetic political implications of their view of emotion are criticized.

PHIL212: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. No objective 
This course is an introduction to the philosophy of literature. The fundamental question discussed in this course is how philosophy, ordinary life and literature are related. How can we draw boundary line between philosophy and literature? How are literary works structured? With these questions the course addresses the philosophical question about the role of art in human life. The continuity of everyday life and the coherence of artistic literature are distinct though closely related. In ancient Greece, Literature was crucial for philosophy´ s own self definition. Subsequent philosophy of literature has been denoted to overcoming Plato´s condemnatory theory. The vast majorities of theories follow Plato in treating literature as a distinct domain, separate from and subordinate to philosophy. But since Romanticism, some have argued for the essential unity of these two enterprises. The course studies the relation between life, literature and philosophy within historical context as well as in contemporary culture.

PHIL214: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. COURSE DESCRIPTION: The Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection is one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the modern era. Although it is a theory of biology with its revolutionary consequences in all life sciences it has also had an enormous impact on science in general, philosophy, religion, and politics the last 150 years. In this course, some of the major concepts and problems of evolutionary biology, such as fitness, adaptation, the structure of the evolutionary theory, the problem of the units of selection, the species problem, are presented and examined from a philosophical perspective.
COURSE OBJECTIVES: At the end of this course, the student will have learned:
basic concepts about the evolutionary theory, such as natural selection, fitness, adaptation;
basic philosophical problems related with the evolutionary theory, such as nature of biological laws/models, biological explanations, the creationism-evolution debate, the tautology problem, reduction, biological teleology, the units of selection problem, the problems about adaptationism, the species problem, biological determinism, evolution of morality and culture.

PHIL248: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Generally speaking, medieval philosophy is taken to run from around the fifth through fifteenth centuries CE, roughly corresponding to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire through the beginning of the Renaissance, which itself is taken as running from the mid-fourteenth through mid-seventeenth centuries. These two periods, then, overlap. To the extent they can be genuinely teased apart, the medieval period is marked by adherence to monotheistic religious tenets and authority as well as to Aristotle, while the Renaissance sees the rediscovery of pre-Christian thought and a decreasing reliance on prior texts and thinkers. However, none of these qualifications can be taken as fully descriptive of either period and their similarities and differences will become apparent in equal measure as we move through the material.
As this is a survey course covering approximately 1200 years of philosophy, it is impossible to do justice to either period, more so than in other survey courses. That said, we will read many of their most important thinkers. We begin with Augustine of Hippo (354-430) and his sermon on the sacking of Rome in 410. We then move to selections from the Roman senator Boethius (477-524); the great Islamic philosophers Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 980-1037) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes, 1126-1198); and the high watermarks of medieval Christian thought as found in Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) and John Duns Scotus (1265/6-1308). With that, we move into the Renaissance with readings from Nicholas of Cusa’s (1401-1464) On Learned Ignorance, Niccolò Machivelli’s (1469-1527) Prince, Martin Luther’s (1483-1546) “Ninety-five Theses,” the Coimbra Commentaries (1591-1606), and closing with Francisco Suárez’s (1548-1617) Metaphysical Disputations.
 
Survey of post-Aristotelian and medieval philosophies. philosophy in the Renaissance; Humanism; controversy between the Platonists and the Aristotelians; scepticism, and Reformation.

PHIL282: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. COURSE DESCRIPTION: The Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection is one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the modern era. Although it is a theory of biology with its revolutionary consequences in all life sciences it has also had an enormous impact on science, philosophy, religion, and politics for the last 150 years. In this course, as we examine the evolutionary thinking by the work of a number of key representative figures in the past and present we will also be questioning as to whether scientific theories, in general, and the evolutionary theory, in particular, are social constructions by searching for values inherent in scientific theories and research.
COURSE OBJECTIVES: The aim of this course is to demonstrate students by concrete examples from the history of evolutionary biology that, although science involves social (nonscientific/epistemic) values both in discovering and testing scientific theories, it, nevertheless, progresses and achieves objective knowledge by removing these values from science.
COURSE TOPICS: Problem of objectivity and subjectivity in science, epistemic (scientific) and non-epistemic (social) values in science, the role of metaphors in science.
 
Problems of the development of science through history.

PHIL343: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Course intended mainly for 3rd and 4th year students in Philosophy. However, 2nd year students may get enrolled as well. Moreover, there may be a small room for students of other departments, who are seriously interested in the course.
 
Course Syllabus: This course contains a substantial reading component. The purpose of this course is to improve students’ reading skills needed for philosophy as well as to discuss what philosophical activity is all about by studying Plato’s dialogue the Meno, and by doing so we shall study Plato’s philosophy and shed some light on what he might understand this activity.
 
This course firstly aims at introducing you to the practice of reading in philosophy by studying thoroughly a text in the Western philosophical tradition. Students will also get to grasp some problems that have been significant to philosophy from its beginnings, the major one of which is the problem of knowledge. In the process of thoroughly studying the text and the arguments appearing in the text, you will develop your own philosophical and analytical skills.
 
As for Plato’s philosophy and his understanding of what this activity entails, the course will also include instruction in finding and defining problems, formulating questions to capture the problems defined, arrangement, developing arguments, revision, and strategies of research.
 
 
The course will be concerned with the selected dialogues of Plato. After a brief introduction to Plato`s conception of Socratic 2410osophizing (in Apology, Crito, Euthyphro) we will trace the development of Plato`s ethical theory from the Socratic ethics of the Protagoras to the Platonic ethics of the Republic; and Plato`s metaphysical theory from the Meno and Phaedo to the Republic and Timaeus. Finally, some attention will be given to his theory of knowledge in the later dialogues, especially the Theaetetus, the Parmenides, and the Sophist.

PHIL344: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. This semester (2021-2022 Fall), the main objective will be to cover a number of Aristotelian subjects, especially concerning his theory of being and theory of mind. The main objective will be to familiarize students with Aristotle's concepts of truth (aletheia) and intellect (nous).
Please also note that in line with the partial normalization process, the classes this term (2021-2022 Fall) will be hybrid: they will be held both in person and also online on Zoom.
 
The course will be concerned with Aristotle`s most famous and influential work Metaphysics. After a brief introduction to Aristotle`s philosophy and its place in the history of ancient philosophy, we will pay particular attention to Aristotle`s conception of `first philosophy` as the most valuable and comprehensive of all sciences, the so-called `metaphysics`. We will trace how Aristotle explores the science that is devoted to the investigation of first causes, of Being as  such and of the form of knowledge that deserves the title `wisdom`. Finally, we will consider Aristotle`s formulation of the fundamental metaphysical problems: the questions concerning the substance, the particular and the universal, form and matter, potentiality and actuality, and finally, the mover and the moved.

PHIL390: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Some of the central philosophical problems of science highlighted by the success, methods and social settings of modern science.
Topics and problems to be covered throughout the course will be selected from the following list –not all topics may be covered in any one semester:
* What is special about the scientific method? What constitutes a scientific approach to investigating the world? Why be scientific? Science vs. pseudo-science or good vs. bad science.
* Does science make inductive assumptions? Does it simply generalise from the cases already investigated? If so, how are such inductive assumptions to be justified?
* Can evidence ever establish scientific theories? If not, what exact role does empirical testing play in science? The role of experiment in the scientific method; the Duhem-Quine Problem; the empirical basis of science; weight of evidence and predictive success.
* Are there any special problems concerned with testing statistical or probabilistic theories?
* Scientific explanation; what are ad hoc explanations and moves? Why should they be avoided in science?
* What is the status of presently accepted scientific theories? The problem of theory-choice (or theory-change) and scientific rationality. What are revolutionary-theory-changes in science? How do revolutionary-theory-changes in science affect the view that science consists of a body of established truths? And how does the phenomenon of revolutionary changes in science affect traditional notions of scientific rationality? Do scientific revolutions involve changes in scientific methodology?
 
Historical and epistemological evaluation of some rationality theories, e.g., Popper`s Falsificationism, Kuhn`s Scientific Revolutions, Feyerabend`s Liberalism, Lakatos`s MSRP and Structural Realism.

PHIL392: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Course Intended for students of Philosophy and other Departments.
 
Course Syllabus: This course, while providing a philosophical and historical account of how non-Euclidean geometries were discovered, deals with some important methodological and historical problems of geometry such as the possibility of methodology of non-empirical sciences, continuity and progress in geometry with special emphasis on case studies in geometry.
 
Course Content: The discovery of non-Euclidean geometries has a long and complicated history. The predominant account of this discovery claims that this history is a linear compilation of geometrical results and should be best understood as a sequence of foundational studies. Moreover, it does not deal with the issues of rationality geometrical progress and revolutions in the history of geometry. So it has some weakness to represent faithfully what went on when such a discovery came about. An historical-cum-methodological account of this discovery shall be offered in terms of methods employed by geometers in problem-solving, the characterization of geometrical language, problems and theories, and the intentions of geometers themselves. Euclid’s and Saccheri’s works will be studied as case studies.
 
Pre-Requisites: Some familiarity with logic and the philosophy and history of science.
 
Written Work, Oral Presentation and Examination: tba.
 
 
 
History of the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries; historical and methodological problems of geometrical progress.

## Entry 710

PHIL404: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. The question of what constitutes sovereignty—the right to (legitimately) rule or govern oneself and/or another—has of late been called into question. What ish my nation? Ish a villain, and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal? What ish my nation? Who talks of my nation?—Shakespeare, Henry V
 
Who or what rules over or governs whom or what? How does this rule or governance operate? Why does it operate in one way and not another? Does it operate in only one way? By what logic, what power, what logical power, or what powerful logic does it operate, if it indeed operates at all? What are its limits, if any? Who determines those limits, if they exist? Who benefits from those limits as determined in a particular fashion? What allows the beneficiaries to benefit and others not to benefit, if that occurs? Should the number of the beneficiaries of the limits of sovereignty themselves be limited? If the limitation of sovereignty necessarily limits its beneficiaries, should sovereignty be limited? Is the limitation of sovereignty necessarily linked to limited beneficiaries? And so on.
            Our goal in this class, then, is to begin to get a handle on what is at stake in this current discussion of sovereignty and to come to grips with whether we can answer any of Captain Macmorris’s (admittedly decontextualized) questions from Henry V with assurance. We will pursue this goal through four texts at the forefront of this discussion.
 
Problems in the philosophy of social science and in political philosophy.

Email: mbeni@metu.edu.tr
Office hours:
Time and venue: Wednesdays 10.40-13.40 (hybrid)
 
Course description: 
The course introduces and explores the main issues of the philosophy of mind including the following ones: what is the mind, and how it is related to the body and the world? Can there be mindfulness independently of bodily modes? Can computers think? How does the mind represent the external world? Can connectionist networks embed representations? What is consciousness? The course considers some of the significant philosophical replies to those questions. It is organized into three main parts. The first part is concerned with the nature of mind and its relationship with the body. The second part focuses on the questions of how to model mind and how to account for its representational capacities (if any). The third part overviews discussions of intentionality, consciousness, and selfhood.
Upon successful completion of the course, the students will acquire the requisite skills to understand some of the main discussions of the field and articulate arguments for and against different positions and examine them critically.
 
The course outcome: 
To develop the skill to read and write about topics presented in the course and similar topics. To understand and critically discuss the basic metaphysical and epistemological views on the nature of the mind and its relationship with the body. To be able to see the relation between epistemological and metaphysical views on the one hand and some fundamental theories of the cognitive sciences and computer science on the other. To be able to reconstruct and critically evaluate the main replies to the questions about the nature of the mind and its relationship with the world.

PHIL411: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. No objective 
This course examines the philosophies of the three leading thinkers of the 17th century: Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz. The emphasis is on the central theses associated with rationalism: (i) that at least some of our concepts are not gained from experience but are innate; and (ii) that reason alone can provide us with knowledge of the external world through `intuition` of self-evident propositions and through `deduction` from those propositions. Selections from the most important works of these philosopherswill be read. Epistemological, metaphysical, ontological, and ethical issues of the Continental Rationalism will be investigated with reference to these central theses. Relations between Continental Rationalism and British Empiricism will be brought into view.

PHIL414: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. No objective 
There has been a great deal of speculation recently on how the evolution of language may explain the dramatic cognitive changes which occurred during the Upper Paleolithic resulting in the emergence of religion, art, long-distance trade, elaborate burial rituals, and complex social structures. Philosophy of language and philosophy of cognition are relevant to understanding the evolution of language and hence to understanding these cognitive changes. The course explores some of these connections.

PHIL421: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Intensive study of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason; the problem of metaphysics and the self-criticism of reason; Kant’s Copernican turn; the constitutive role of concepts in knowledge; the possibility of synthetic a priori knowledge; the cognitive faculties of the human mind; Kant’s theory of representation; the questions of the ends, the limits and the vocation of human reason.
Our text will be the Critique of Pure Reason. The central theme of the course will be Kant’s criticism of metaphysics which finds its formulation in “transcendental idealism”.  This theme obviously extends to the question of the ends, the limits and the vocation of human reason.
The aim of the course is to provide a way of entrance to Kant’s system of Critiques, which is highly influential and significant for the history of philosophy.
At the end of this course the students will learn:
*Kant's critical philosophy
*Basic concepts of the Kantian theoretical philosophy
 
 
This course will be concerned with Immanuel Kant`s most famous and influential work Critique of Pure Reason. After a brief introduction to Kant`s philosophy and its relation to empiricist and rationalist philosophies, we will pay particular attention to Kant`s conception of `critique`. We will trace how Kant explores the possibility of a priori knowledge and of transcendental subjectivity. Finally, we will discuss the problem of the unity of reason, i.e., the unity of reason in its theoretical and practical employment. In this respect, we will bring the first Critique into dialogue with the second Critique.

This course will be concerned with G.W.F. Hegel`s most famous and influential work Phenomenology of Spirit. After a brief introduction to Hegel`s philosophy and its relation to Kantian philosophy, we will pay particular attention to Hegel`s conception of `phenomenological method`. We will trace how Hegel explores the development of consciousness from its most ordinary form as `spirit`. Finally, we will bring Hegel`s thought into dialogue with contemporary continental philosophies.

Nietzsche's critique of Western traditional metaphysics and morality
Nietzsche's relation to Kant and Schopenhauer
academic reading and writing skills
 
Kants analysis of the principles underlying morality leads him to the statement of the categorical imperative, an idea that has been tremendously influential in the history of moral philosophy, yet also widely misunderstood. In this course we will first of all study the various formulations of the categorical imperative in Kants Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals. But in order to be able to assess the status of Kants moral philosophy in the history of philosophy, we will also look at a number of influential figures who  in their different ways  can be seen to have gone beyond Kant in their understanding of the role, status and functioning of morality.

PHIL433: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. David Hilbert, a 20th century logician, famously said: “The infinite! No other question has ever moved so profoundly the spirit of man; no other idea has so fruitfully stimulated his intellect; yet no other concept stands in greater need of clarification….” As pointed out by Hilbert, the concept of infinity has been an important topic in philosophy since the time of early Greek philosophers. In addition to its philosophical importance, it also has significant mathematical aspects. For example, the concept forms the basis of some counter-intuitive mathematical results, such as being able to paint an infinite surface with a finite amount of paint. Thus, a thorough investigation of the concept of infinity will need to have both a philosophical dimension and a mathematical/logical dimension. This proposed course aims to provide such an investigation. The investigation will be carried out in three overlapping dimensions: historical, metaphysical, and mathematical. In the first dimension, the development of the concept of infinity will be traversed, starting from early Greek thought and ending with 20th century views on infinity. The main focus of the metaphysical dimension of the course will be the distinction between potential infinity and actual infinity. The arguments for and against the existence of actual infinity will be thoroughly examined. In addition to these arguments, the metaphysical dimension of the course will also include an analysis of human finitude and the possibility of infinite beings. The mathematical dimension will cover early paradoxes of motion and time, Galileo’s “paradox”, Torricelli’s trumpet, Cantor’s transfinite mathematics, and some theorems relevant to the discussion of infinity.

PHIL461: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Course Description:  The main subject matter of this course will be the concept or phenomenon of death where we will be reading and evaluating principally contemporary literature.
In the first half of the course we will discuss inter alia the following: our conception of the human soul; the onto-epistemology of death; common conception of death as being “mysterious”; death and literature (the case of Elias Canetti); the contemporary approach to aging and dying in our culture; characterization of life as fabulae; and the existential-hermeneutic philosophy (specifically, Martin Heidegger’s view) regarding death as the ultimate phenomenological limit.
In the second half of the course we will focus chiefly on the notion of “harm due to dying”.  We will start with a classical view presented by Epicurus (4th cent. B.C.E.) and study the contemporary reaction the his “harm argument”.  We will also briefly discuss the Ancient and Spinozistic approaches to death.  Another major issue we will talk about will be the concept of immortality.  We will examine the notion of immortality, and then consider the pertinent analyses and philosophically evaluate its desirability.
Reading material:  A course package will be available at DereaÄzÄ± Fotokopi Ciltevi.  The reader contains selected articles from the following books:

PSY463: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY. This course is designed to present a general overview to the field of cultural and cross-cultural psychology and introduce you to the idea of cultural variation in human behavior. In doing this it examines only a small selection of the theoretical, empirical and applied issues of human behavior across cultures.
The rationale behind this course is that what may hold true in many contemporary, Western European and North American societies is not necessarily the norm in other societies. In order to better understand these differences, we will examine psychological constructs and theories through relativist and universalist perspectives, sometimes referred to as cultural psychology and cross-cultural psychology, respectively. This examination will seek to compare and contrast what is universal in human behavior and what is shaped and interpreted by cultural variations.

Students are expected to submit 3 progress reports (Week 6, Week 12, and during Finals). For the first progress report everyone in class is expected to have presented literature at least once and prepared an experiment idea/timeline. Second progress report is expected to include a presentation of the experiment design and pilot data. Final report can be a manuscript or a project proposal depending on the progress during the semester.
Taking initiative is key to success in the course. At the end of semester, ideally, the students will have learnt how to take responsibility for a research project, such as, coming up with applicable and fruitful research ideas, acquiring ethics approval, finding funding and participants, analysing & reporting the outcomes and meeting deadlines while doing all of these.

PSY3402: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY. This course is designed to present a general overview to the field of cultural and cross-cultural psychology and introduce you to the idea of
cultural variation in human behavior. In doing this it examines only a small selection of the theoretical, empirical and applied issues of
human behavior across cultures.
The rationale behind this course is that what may hold true in many contemporary, Western European and North American societies is not
necessarily the norm in other societies. In order to better understand these differences, we will examine psychological constructs and theories
through relativist and universalist perspectives, sometimes referred to as cultural psychology and cross-cultural psychology, respectively.
This examination will seek to compare and contrast what is universal in human behavior and what is shaped and interpreted by cultural
variations.
 
A general overview to the field of cultural and cross-cultural psychology that aims to examine a selection of the theoretical, empirical and applied issues of human behavior across cultures.

CRP495: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF CITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING. The terms “urban” and “politics” went hand in hand throughout the history. As Lefebvre puts: “There is politics of space because space is political”. Urban life embraced power and politics from the very emergence of the human settlements. The aim of this course is to introduce the students to the basic concepts and theories of political power, state, local state and their analysis in urban context. The course is organized into three parts. The first part is devoted to the methodological problems which is indispensable for the scientific analysis of social and political issues. Such an introduction is a must, to comprehend, evaluate and debate the material presented in the latter sections of the course properly. Part two examines in a summary manner the theories developed about the state (i.e. the ultimate organization of political power) in general and the capitalist state in particular. Part three deals with the local state, the role played by and functions fulfilled by the state in urban context. The course will be conducted in a lecturedemonstration mode. Readings are to be regarded as reference material, “suggested” rather than “required”. Because of the length of the overall list, students will be expected to read selectively- choosing some areas for intensive reading and others for skimming according to particular interests.

ECE356: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. This course will introduce students the importance of outdoor education for young children. Moreover, the characteristics of ideal outdoor environment, risk and safety in outdoor environment will be studied. The course will also focus on the pedagogies related to nature-based education, the relation between sustainability and outdoor education. In addition, participants in this course will be provided strategies to plan planning outdoor activities for young children and effective teacher strategies in outdoor environments.
 
 
The importance of outdoor play is widely acknowledged by early childhood researchers.  However, studies, which are conducted to investigate teachers outdoor play practices, proposed educational implications in relation to in-service and pre-service training programs about outdoor education. They suggested that in-service and pre-service teacher training programs are needed about facilitation of childrens outdoor play by teachers. As those researchers indicated, in-service teacher training could be one way to form teachers beliefs and improve their outdoor play practices. However, when teachers are graduated from university and participated to the regular system, they have generally configured their beliefs in relation to teaching and learning. When it is considered that beliefs are resistant to change, the role of pre-service teacher training programs in constructing pre-service teachers beliefs becomes more crucial. In other words, pre-service teacher training programs might be more effective to construct pre-service teachers beliefs of outdoor education and to make them capable in terms of facilitating childrens outdoor play and learning. In this regard, several research that have been conducted to examine the role of pre-service teacher training programs in forming pre-service teachers beliefs constitute an evidence for this foresight. From this point of view, providing an outdoor education course for pre-service teachers would be golden opportunity to train qualified and capable students in the issue of outdoor education. In addition, in Turkey, curriculum for early childhood education suggested teachers to conduct learning activities in outdoor environment as much as possible. Based on this guide curriculum, teachers are expected to create their own plans. At that point, as the teachers will be decision makers of the curriculum and classroom it is important to make pre-service students to develop positive attitudes toward outdoor education. Due to aforementioned reasons, presenting a course for outdoor education is significant for pre-service early childhood teacher training program.

They sense that within their everyday worlds, they cannot overcome their troubles, and in this feeling, they are often quite correct” (1959, p. 1). Social phenomena and related “traps” have become increasingly complicated in the age of globalization. Consequently, sociology, as a disciple undertaking the task of riddling such traps, expanded its scope of application through different disciplines and professions.

SOC131: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. Although anthropology had built a reputation for producing the knowledge of “other” people’s culture, thoughts and behaviors; the discipline already made its home-coming several decades ago. Since then, anthropological perspectives and methods have gradually become of importance to understand and compete with highly diversified socio-cultural encounters in the contemporary world. Today, the Kula traders of New Guiana can help us to understand financial markets and crises (Keir Martin, Guardian – 23.04.2012). For this reason, developing an anthropological understanding would be critical for anyone who would like to participate in global society.

Disasters are fundamentally sociological events. First of all, the course will try to discuss how to sociologically conceptualize  what a `disaster`is? what is a `hazard`? What is a`hazard risk`? Why we cannot justify the term `natural` to explain disasters? How can we understand the root drivers behind disasters? The course will then continue with a brief analysis of different theoretical discussions and sociological perspectives for understanding disasters? The course will continue explaining how disasters may enhance the previous social inequalities before and may lead to multidimensional, contextual and intersectional vulnerabilities during and after the disasters. The course will then focus on the difference between `disaster risk management` and `disaster risk reduction` approaches. While the first one is emphasizing the period after a disaster, the later refers to preventive strategies, referring to risk perception, awareness and preparedness. The role of NGOs will be also covered in the course. Especially there will be a discussion on whether we can talk of a  `recovery` or a major social change after a disaster. In the course, various major disasters experienced in the world will be presented. Among them disaster/climate change induced migration will be particularly emphasized.

Following this framework, the process of nation-state building in Turkey is discussed with reference to various forms of resistance movements and formal political opposition experienced between the years of 1919 and the early 1940s. The ideology of nationalism and nation building is emphasized.

Introduce students to the research in environmental sociology and to emphasize how a sociological perspective can inform our understanding of changes in the natural world. Although environmental sociology encompasses a large and growing literature, the course will focus upon several prominent works and will introduce students to the fundamental issues and debates in the field.
Promote students’ ability to evaluate the existing research and to understand its implications. Class discussions, lectures, writing assignments, and the final paper will all help in the realization of this goal.
Promote the development of a global perspective on environmental issues. Just as processes of environmental and social change are linked, developments originating in isolated regions often have worldwide implications. Conversely, global trends are often particularly manifest in specific locales. This course will attempt to make those critical connections evident.
Enhance students’ writing and research abilities. Toward this end, each student in the course will complete regular writing assignments and a research paper.

 
Environmental sociology is a field of inguiry that focuses on the relationship between society and the biophysical environment. This course will consider social relationships at both the global and local levels, as well as in urban and rural localities. It examines how human societies affect the environment and how human societies are shaped by the environment.

SOC417: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. This course examines and compares cultures through materials and practices embedded in everyday life with anthropological perspectives.  One of the most important subjects of everyday life is food.  Food is more than sustenance; it is our lifestyle, a nexus among people, it brings memories and nostalgia.  Through food we create and present our identities (e.g., national, regional, religious, ethnic, gender and class); for example, tamales are significant food among Mexicans and South Americans.  Does it follow that the consumption of tamales signifies regionalism or nationalism?  Are all pizza Italian?  Is pizza served at American franchised restaurants Italian or American cuisine?  Is barbeque for men more than for women and sweets for women more than men?  How do people feel nostalgic for foreign originated food?  Do people consume no meat for good health or for political statement?  The relationships between food and people are complex.  And, it is an individual researcher’s goal to discover, analyze and interpret the complexity.
By exploring foodways—the traditions and customs in production, consumption and distribution of food—of others and ours, we will learn the different ways of using food to create and present identities; how and in what circumstances people use food to distinguish them from one another as well as connect with others?  How do they recreate new identities or diminish old ones in order to be accepted in new places or by new people?  The primary goal of this course is to develop a critical awareness of cultural similarities as much as differences.  Throughout the course, you should always ask yourself: What is culture? 
We study food as an academic subject through readings, films and class/group discussions.  There are no right and wrong opinions as each of us have a different background, which has shaped our perspectives.  However, you should be thinking about food in terms of anthropology.  As a final project, you will do a food-based research paper—to examine food of other culture rather than your own, such as outside your region, ethnicity, religion, class, and gender.  In your paper, you should pose a central research question, for example, “How do people in America present their class identity through sushi consumption?” or “How is simit significant to everyday life in Turkey?”  By examining the ways by which others shape their identity through food, you learn about their culture and people.  This helps you to be self-reflective with your own culture as well.  In your research paper, you should discuss how a particular food impacts people’s everyday life and the ways by which they form their identities. 
 
The course probes such social and cultural questions as  ´Are there different kinds of rationality? ´,  ´Does language limit and control thought? ´,  ´What kind of difficulties arise when we attempt to translate from one language, or culture, into another?,  ´Are there universal moral principles? ´,  ´Is it possible to compare different cultures? ´ Basic concepts such as self, reason and sanity, money and wealth, religious beliefs, and health will be subjected to critique.

SOC423: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. This course aims to explore the role played by culture in generating, maintaining and reproducing inequalities. It first explores the varying models of culture in the theories of inequality. Then, it interrogates how seemingly individual and random choices and experiences, such as our tastes, leisure time activities, friends and emotions are related to inequality. Throughout the course, the most frequently used analysis methods and the most controversial debates on class cultures will be introduced. The last three weeks aim to utilise the overviewed concepts and debates to understand class-cultural hierarchies in Turkey. By the end of the course, the students will comprehend the relationship between culture, class and consumption, as well as their various workings in the everyday life of Turkey.

SOC427: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. The course examines the formation and dynamics of ethnic groups in the contemporary world. It surveys major topics, theoretical definitions/debates and approaches in the field of race and ethnicity. Moreover, it also examines social and ethnic relations as part of larger social systems by emphasizing the relationship between ethnicity on the one hand and nations, state, class, minority groups, gender, power, and politics on the other.
 
The aim of the course is to provide academic background, conceptual clarity, and guidance to the students around the key concepts of race and ethnicity. Classical studies on nationalism and state-formation emphasize territoriality, clearly delimited boundaries, and a homogenous population with a focus on universalism, inclusion, civility, modern tolerance, transnational integration and civic nationhood. The increasing emphasis on particularity, exclusion, violence, ancient hatreds, and national disintegration (stemming mainly from the post-communist east Europe and the former Soviet Union and the increasing number of immigrants in Europe) constitutes a challenge to the analytical gains of the mainstream literature on nationalism. In this context ethnic group formation, ethnic integration and ethnic conflict appear among the defining phenomena of the modern era. While one understanding in the field of race and ethnicity emphasizes membership in definite groups (similarity), the other emphasizes cultural differentiation (difference); both aiming to explain and understand human diversity through the processes of social identification and interaction. Ethnic integration and ethnic conflict can be divided into several sub-categories, such as assimilation, melting pot or cultural pluralism (multiculturalism) on the one hand and discrimination, ethnic cleansing or genocide on the other. Since ethnic groups can (and often do) generate various forms of conflict, ethnicity appears as one of the most controversial topics in the literature. Most theoretical approaches to understanding racial and ethnic identification or racial and ethnic relations remain inconclusive. Thus, it is important to emphasize a broader understanding of the concept of ethnicity as a social phenomenon. Ethnicity also has political, historical, economic, and religious dimensions none of which can be ignored. In this context, conceptions like “the return of the repressed” or “elite manipulation” need to be critically reconsidered in relation to the concepts of collective identity (and its expressive forms) and (ethnic and racial) social movements.

SOC428: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. The aim of this course is to study on the subject of city culture in the global world within a framework of  interdisciplinary approach and develop some field methods and put them in application in order to enable students to explore different aspects of the city culture that they live in.
 
Exploration of the cultures of cities requires to ask a series of questions: How do cities use culture? Who plays a leading role in the formation of cities’ cultures? Who controls the “symbolic economy” of the cities as Zukin (1994) uses the term? Who really occupy the central spaces of cities? Which components of a city life are essential for the formation of city cultures? How does the history of a city play a role in the formation of its current cultural characteristics? How are the city cultures embodied by its inhabitants and which inhabitants embody which characteristics of  city cultures? In short how the cultures of cities are produced, consumed and reproduced by whom? And finally how all these questions can be applied to Ankara, the capital of Turkey. 
 
City Culture in the global world with an interdisciplinary world with an interdisciplinary approach: field methods and their application on different aspects of the city culture throughout different socio-economic and political periods; Ankara as the capital of Turkey and city culture in Ankara and Turkish modernization.

SOC466: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. Course Description
This is a reading and writing intensive seminar on human beings’ universal metabolic relationship with the rest of nature and the manifold historical-geographical forms this relationship takes. Moving from the European colonial expansion and the Caribbean transnationalism as a starting point of problematization, our discussion will often revolve broadly around the intersection of political economy and political ecology. We will critically discuss such issues as the relational and intersecting processes of appropriation of nature through human labor, the production of space and social ecologies; appropriation of labor’s surplus by the owners of the means of production; and the relational and transnational formation of social identities such as race, ethnicity, and gender through a historical perspective both in colonial and post-colonial contexts across the globe.
Course Objectives:

To introduce and debate the relationality among the labor regimes, surplus extraction, land ownership systems and the construction of various social identities along different axes of social difference such as race, gender, ethnicity, and nationality.
To problematize and discuss the differences between, imperialism, transnationalism, colonialism, post-colonialism, nationalism, and universalism through a historical materialist framework by specifically examining class formations, land ownership and labor regimes in the context of the emergence and consolidation of European political modernity.
To discuss how above-mentioned processes are integral to the production of socio-ecological environments various peoples lived in and the historical formation of contemporary globalized political-ecological issues.    

Course Requirements
Attendance and Participation (20%)
Attending the seminar: 1 point each week (14 Points in Total)
Attending the discussion: 6 Points in total
Inasmuch as you are free to come and go to our seminars as you like as free individuals, this course will evaluate your ability to bring your bodies and ideas into the classroom. There is a reason for such tyranny: The true gift of seminars is its collectivity, or what Marx calls “the natural advantages of cooperation” in the production process. It is in the classroom where we have a chance to express the way we read texts, hear others’ way of reading them, and challenge ourselves and our fellow readers in a fruitful collective environment.
Honest intellectual engagement in class discussions is, after all, the most challenging demand this course will impose on you.   
 
Critical Discussion Leading (10%) 
Throughout the semester each of you will spin-off the in-class discussion with a presentation that should take 10-to-15-minutes. If the number of students exceed 13, this presentation can be done in pairs, in which case the two parts of the presentation should not exceed 20 minutes in total. You are expected to critically review the assignments of the week, lay down the main arguments and major points of discussion and put them into a dialogue with each other and the other texts of the syllabus whenever possible. Note that this excludes simple summaries. The primary aim of this exercise is to encourage you to construct a productive intellectual engagement with the assigned texts rather than being passive recipients. The experience from the past few semesters shows that it becomes very productive when you come up with critical questions derived from the text(s) to enrich your presentation. This enables us to pick up those questions to facilitate the discussion. When there are multiple texts in a particular week, you are expected to cover all the assigned readings and metabolize them in a single presentation.
Note that the presentations that are unable to lay down the main arguments and crucial points of discussion in 15 minutes (20 if there are two presenters) and take longer are subject to point loss. It is an important skill to be able structure your talk in a time that is allocated to you, be it 5 minutes, 15 minutes or more. It is possible to identify the main arguments and major points of discussion of any text in 15 minutes, unless you try to summarize it.   
Reading Notes (21%)
Throughout the semester you will write two-page response papers to seven weekly assignments of your choice. Each will account for 3% of your final grade. The principles of discussion leading applies to the notes as well. I would like you to critically discuss the assigned texts but given that you have two pages, you are encouraged to pick a point or two that you identify as interesting, important or vital for understanding the texts. You may again put these points into a dialogue with other texts of the course whenever possible. Note that this excludes simple summaries. The papers should be uploaded to turn-it-in until midnight on Tuesdays in order to facilitate the in-class discussion the next day. Since late papers would defeat this purpose, they will not be evaluated.
You should come prepared to make those points and be able to defend them in the classroom when necessary.
Term Paper (50%)
You will submit a final paper at the end of the semester. Your term paper topic is entirely up to you, i.e., you can problematize any aspect of this course, as long as it inspires you, be it theoretical/conceptual or empirical. You can consult me anytime if you are not sure how your intended paper topic could address the debates covered throughout the semester. No matter what your topic is about, I expect you to construct your research topic, produce clear research questions, which will then determine the literature you will review in order to situate your paper and your arguments. This holistic and relational methodology/epistemology will be part of our discussions throughout the semester, which will help you with the construction of your paper.
Your papers should be 15-20 pages. (Double-spaced, times new roman font, size 12.)
Academic dishonesty and the expropriation of labor of others in any form will not be tolerated. This is not because you have to respect the intellectual private property rights, but the labor of others.
 
The course explores the relational and intersecting processes of appropriation of nature through human labor, the production of space and social ecologies; appropriation of the surplus created by labor by the owners of the means of production; formation of social identities such as race, ethnicity and class through a historical perspective both in colonial and post-colonial contexts across the globe.

SOC497: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. The question of secularism has become an issue of intense theoretical and political debate in recent decades. This is mostly due to a revival of religion as global fact. Recent developments such as fundamentalist upsurges (Islamic or Evangelical), the growing Muslim population in Western countries and the resurgence of religion in world affairs have put religion and secularism among the crucial issues for many Western and Eastern societies including Turkey. Thus, the issue of secularism has become a major research topic for sociologists. 
 
 
 
This course aims to acquaint students with the secularization debate. Enlightenment, secularizing effect of modernity, classical theories of secularization and recent approaches, different dimensions of secularization and Western secularisms will be critically analyzed. The development of secularism in different Western countries will be studied with a comparative perspective.

SOC498: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. Secularism has become a subject of intense theoretical and political debate in recent decades. This is mostly due to a revival of religion as a global fact. Developments such as Islamic fundamentalist upsurges and the resurgence of religion in world affairs after the events of 9/11, and more recently, the formation of ISIS, the Charlie Hebdo attack have put religion and secularism among the crucial issues not only in Western societies but also in Muslim-minority and Muslim-majority societies including Turkey. These recent developments have also brought questions about free speech into sharp focus.
Decreasing commitment to traditional religions and the modern disconnection between faith communities and socio-cultural identities via the development of new religious movements are conducive to the development of fundamentalism. Also, individualization of faith and the disassociation of faith communities from ethnic and national identities are becoming widespread. In other words, the divide between culture and religion is growing as an important social fact and thus, attracting the attention of many sociologists.
Especially since the so called ‘war on terror’, the academic debate over the compatibility of Islam with secularism and democracy has become a subject of public discussion and thus, the issue of secularism a major research topic for sociologists. The main debates that the sociologists studying religion and secularism are engaged in, are as follows: The relationship between secularism/secular state and democracy; the place of Shari’a in Muslim societies; The relationship between Islam and the state throughout the history of Islam; the (im)possibility of realizing an ‘Islamic State’; the (possible) consequences of the coercive enforcement of Shari’a by the state; the threat of majoritarianism; the perception of Islamic upsurge in the West; the failure of the idea that we are living in a secular world, especially considering the limited secularization and secularism experienced in Muslim societies; the axiomatic nature of belief in the Muslim world as opposed to the West; attempts of creating a secular ethic and the difficulty in determining the principles of such ethic through a consensus; and the visibility of  religious markers in the public space have been hot topics for sociologists studying religion and secularism. 
The study of Muslim-minority and Muslim-majority societies, especially of the case of Turkey, will contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between Islam, secularization and the secular state; the increasingly important role that religion plays in these societies and the debates over the importance of secularism for the establishment of democratic political regimes.  
 
 
The principal aim of this course is to acquaint students with the secularization process, the secular state in predominantly Muslim societies and also in Muslim-minority states. Experience of secularization, laicité and secular state, and the relationship between Islam and politics will be critically and comparatively examined in different countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Egypt, Iran, Israel and Turkey.

BA4104: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. Here are the words of  Serdar Devrim from Hürriyet Ä°K, dated     June 7, 2015   “Neden olmuyor acaba?” 
“ You have looked through his CV, his LinkedIn account, called his references, searched for his traces on social media, invited him for an interview 2-3 times to test his patience and nerves, and, finally, you have hired the CEO’s wife’s best friend’s daughter…
Just kidding! You have found the one who is closest to being the right person for the right job and hired him. Depending, of course, on how lucky you were(!). You have agreed on salary, benefits, working conditions and the actual job to be done, and shaken hands. 
 
Let’s say; you are great manager, a superb HR person and you knew very well what you wanted and who you were looking for. You carried out the recruitment process perfectly.
Still yet, every hire is a gamble, a dice-roll, getting a double-six has a probability of 1 in 36. There will for sure be some lack of knowledge and objectivity.
The situation is the same for the hired personnel. How well did she introduce herself? Besides, how well does she know herself? How deliberately, objectively and well did she decide? How well did she know the company? How well did she understand what is expected from her? etc, etc…
 
             The interviewing process is a kind of sales activity. In this case, you are the product and the salesperson. In this course you are going to practice how to “sell” yourself  to your prospective employer.  An interview of 15-30 minutes could change all your professional carrier, even your life; like the university exam you had entered 4 years ago.
 
This course aims to enhance the student`s ability to secure a job that matches his or her values, interests and skills. The course also focuses on developing job interviewing and presentation skills.

5. To improve students’ ability to articulate ideas about and to respond to the poems against the backdrop of different philosophical schools.
6. To study the works of poets who were excluded from the canonical texts and anthologies and to bring to attention the literary potential of these figures by re-reading them from a new vantage point.
 
This course will explore the shifting meanings of modern and British within poetic practice, charting a literary history from the late nineteenth to the late twentieth century. The first several weeks of the course will treat some of the currents that gave rise to modernist poetry in Britain, including movements such as Imagism and Vorticism, and the new kinds of experience brought about by World War I. The middle part of the course will be centrally concerned with two major figures of high modernism, T.S. Eliot and W.B. Yeats. The final part of the course will deal largely with responses to and articulations within the terms set out by modernist poetry: for example, W.H. Audens diagnosis of English culture between the wars; Irish, Scots, Welsh poets negotiation of minority cultures within British modernity; and Philip Larkins hostility toward modernisms experimentalism and cosmopolitanism. The student will identify and explain the social, religious, philosophical and economic forces of the period and read and identify modernist poets.

major formal and thematic features of the formal realist, modernist, postcolonial and postmodern novel
basic tools and theories of literary analysis

 
The years from the Great Exhibition (1851) to the Second Reform Bill (1867) were a period of enormous vitality in the English novel. Major works by Dickens, Thackeray, Charlotte Bronte, Trollope, George Eliot, Gaskell, and others capitalized on the burgeoning of serial publication and circulating libraries; on unprecedented growth of consumer capitalism at home and imperial dominance abroad; on worshipful audiences ranging from distinguished literary critics, to eminent leaders of society and politics, to vast numbers of middle and lower class readers. The result was a novel of confident power and narrative scope. By focusing on this period, we are able to survey many of the major authors of Victorian fiction while attending closely to a specific set of historical developments, class relations, and gender issues. The aim of the course is to instruct the students about the characteristics of novel as a literary genre and to show the classroom techniques for teaching the realist novel and to introduce them to the Victorian novel by close study of major texts from this period.

IR224: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. The course instructs on the philosophy of science and philosophy of language, two distinct areas of philosophy arguably at the heart of the concept of academic learning. The instruction aims to facilitate an exploration of the question of method for social and political research in the wider setting of human sciences. The so-called second great debate within the discipline of International Relations, roughly between traditionalism and behavioralism, is arguably still key to the assessments of method in the study area. The course seeks to inform students on this debate in the context of the overall question of method in social and political research towards generating knowledge. Students are expected to gain skills and competencies in relation to a basic set of issues in research.

What is knowledge?
What is fact?
How is knowledge claimed to be generated in academic research?
What exactly is research?
What are the possibly inherent limitations in digging for data?
In what specific ways do researchers suggest possible distinctions between fact and value?
What to make of concepts such as theory, interpretation, objectivity and subjectivity in the acquisition and use of social and political data?

 
The aim of the course is to provide students with a basic knowledge of research methods in the social sciences, with special emphasis on research methods in International Relations. The course has the twofold aim of acquainting students with epistemological issues in the conduct of research in the social  sciences, while also providing students with practical research skills ,including research design, data collection and analysis, and use  of library resources.

Global order has changed with the end of the Cold War. The old defining struggle between a capitalist West and a communist East has passed. Since then, some key policy discussions led by the North have linked national and international security to questions about potential future dangers of social and political disruptions resulting from environment degradation and economic underdevelopment in the South. Once again the world is divided into the North and the South, with the North making decisions to maintain global political and economic status quo –inadequate distribution of natural resources and wealth-  and safeguarding security, and the South being managed without its consent. This course aims to provide the students with a comprehensive understanding of the North-South relations from the perspective of environment, development and security.

IR328: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. Is war (the use of force in international politics) reducible to a science with immutable facts and logics? If so, what is the utility of strategy and how does it relate to international relations? How does any of this help decisionmakers obtain security? For that matter, what even is security and how does it contrast with peace? If you have ever had any questions like these, Security and Strategy will be a great starting point. The goal of this course is to familiarize students with concepts like strategy and security, introduce them to the International Security subfield of IR, and discuss specialized topics that lie at the intersection of IR Theory, Security, and Anthropology. By the conclusion of this course, students can expect to develop a precise understanding of the concept of strategy with its numerous nuances, the role of force in world politics, and deliberate on the precise origins and meanings of concepts like war and peace. The students will also receive an introduction into basic debates in Security Studies as they learn about traditional topics such as war and nuclear deterrence, as well as more recent discussions about political violence, non-state actors, and the illicit global economy.
 
This course examines the range of security threats that the international community faces at the beginning of the new millennium and discusses, both at the level of discourse and the level of practice, how the international community is responding to the persistence of such threats as nuclear proliferation and terrorism and the emergence of new ones such as chemical and biological warfare, pandemics and mass migration. Special emphasis will be placed on comparing and contrasting traditional security paradigm with newly emerging ones, as well as their complex interaction.

IR329: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. At the end of this course students will learn;
The domestic political framework of Turkish foreign policy.
Evolution of Turkey's political system.
The impact of political actors, institutions, and ideologies in the domestic and foreign policy of Turkey.
 
Foreign policy has conventionally been understood as detached from the domestic policy environment. This is derived from the realist assumption that there exists a clear demarcation line between the domestic and the international. Yet this assumption has been questioned by theoretical analysis as well as practical developments in recent years. This course aims at elaborating domestic sources of foreign policy making in the context of Turkish politics. It is based on the hypothesis that an `interactional` approach better serves to the understanding of both Turkish domestic politics and Turkish foreign policy. Thus the course will explain domestic sources of foreign policy issues, like democratization, human rights, the Kurdish question, the role of the military in Turkish politics etc.

IR374: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. Since its inception the EU has been an ambigious and politically contested project. In recent years, controversial issues such as deepening, differentiation and enlargement, politicization of European integration and the latest crises have tested the EU to its limits and increasingly divided political elites and mass publics. Starting with a solid overview of the post-Maastricht European integration process in transformation, this course will analyse the key issues and debates related to the political system of the EU and to the politics of European integration. While most mainstream courses on the EU describe the history, the institutions, policy areas and theorizing about European integration, this course aims at familiarising the students with the key controversies that have shaped the Union and the recent crises that are now openly reshaping the EU policy process(es), polity and politics, both empirically and theoretically. Therefore, a basic knowledge of and familiarity with the process of European integration and the EU institutional system is required.

IR422: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. The first part of the course deals with the basics, which includes an engagement with the foundational concepts of the IR discipline as well as the concept of “theory” itself. In the second part of the course, we discuss the major paradigms –a concept you will become familiar with in this course– of IR. Paradigms for our purposes refer to the totality of assumptions, thought patterns, theories, research questions, methods, and programs pertaining to a collectively imagined framing of the social world. Part III examines the important omissions. Many of the major paradigms proceed from a structural understanding of world politics that focus on the interactions of states. They tend not to engage with deeper issues of world politics such as its main constituent actors like the state. We need to grapple with the nexus of system and unit-level phenomena by situating the state historically and among major IR theories. Next, we assess the state of knowledge production the discipline, focusing not only on the relative neglect of non-Western approaches to IR but also by problematizing the omission of gender as a significant factor in world politics. We will end the course by discussing the future of the international order via an appraisal/critique of contemporary U.S. foreign policy. At this point, students will be well placed to excel in their final take-home exam. The final, Part IV, looks at contemporary, critical and emancipatory aspects of IR Theory by scrutinizing the constituent elements of the social world and the power dynamics therein. It asks students to think about what other kinds of hierarchies exist in the social world.
 
 
This course offers a systematic and comprehensive survey of contending classical and contemporary, traditional and behavioral theories of international relations.

IR484: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. No objective 
International relations is often understood as the study of politics premised on inter-governmental relations. Therefore, mainstream theoretical accounts tend to privilege interaction among states as the paramount, if not only or exclusive, site of thematization. As a result, the global context is reduced in mainstream treatments to security, diplomacy and aspects of inter-governmental association. This course, seeking to remedy this gap, probes into the trans-national, trans-local, inter-ethnic traces and bonds in the wider global context through an exploration of various themes in the disciplines other than IR.

This course examines the political developments between the French Revolution, 1789, and the Great War, 1918. During these two centuries the political scene of Europe was transformed drastically. The 19th century witnessed the destruction of the ancien regime which was under continuous pressure from the emerging capitalism and the bourgeoisie class. The age of revolution was followed by the rise of nationalism, which created a new European state system. The evolving political events, finally led to the WWI, which caused the collapse of three empires in Europe and to the expansion of the European nation state system. In this course, our purpose is to analyze the new cultural forms expressing these changes and the major economic dynamics that influenced this period.

ADM1324: This course belongs to department of POLITICAL SCIENCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. For most of human history, humans lived in small groups who hunted and gathered their food, but around 8,000 B.C., things changed. Humans developed agriculture, settled in urban communities and eventually built huge empires, created religious institutions and explored the planet. In many areas of life, civilization brought about striking improvements and innovations. On the other hand, oppression, exploitation, and massive human suffering accompanied civilizations.
 
The goal of this course is to provide you with a foundation for understanding the world in which we live, keeping in mind humanity’s accomplishments as well as failures. Learning about history is not just memorizing a sequence of events, or a bunch of facts and dates; the point is to critically examine continuity and change over time. The large scope of this course will encourage more synthesis of ideas and integration of knowledge than thorough information on particular topics.
 
The course is arranged so as to avoid two common pitfalls of teaching and learning about civilizations. First, it will be stressed that the global dominance of Europe is a phenomenon that occurred only after c. 1500 and it is a mistake to project it backwards and read the whole world history from the perspective of European hegemony.  Secondly, historians of civilizations usually tell the stories of glorious empires, states, armies, monuments, wars, treaties, great men, etc. and tend to ignore women, the poor, peasants, slaves, and so on. In this course, we will put special emphasis on how important historical developments influenced those social groups who have traditionally been written off of history.

This course aims to introduce and discuss changing conceptions of modernity in social and political theory from the mid-19th / early 20th to the early 21st century. The mediating dynamic of change between the conceptions of early and late modernity is described through changes in the political-economic organization of capitalism. This can be summed up as the transformation of nationally organized capitalism towards a disorganized, global capitalism. In the new sociology of the late-modern societies it is argued that contemporary societies take new forms and undergo new experiences as they are exposed to global uncertainties and complexity arising from the decomposition of organized capitalism. This course is designed with the expectation that the students will have a comprehensive understanding of changing forms of modernity from its inception to its novel forms in contemporary times.

FLE379: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION. This course is an introductory course to cognitive linguistics. Cognitive Linguistics is the study of the mind through language and the study of language as a cognitive function. Cognitive Linguistics has the goals to study how cognitive mechanisms like memory, attention and the representation of the language(s) in the mind are used during language behavior. Research in Cognitive Linguistics is multi-disciplinary; evidence is drawn from text analysis, language acquisition, language change, psycholinguistic experimentation, and brain imaging, among other sources. The purpose of this course is to provide a general orientation in Cognitive Linguistics, an understanding of its central themes and assumptions, and exposure to its empirical methods.We will discuss main issues in cognitive linguistics and some of the many connections that exist between linguistics and human cognition. The goal of this course is to lead students to a cognitive approach to the study of language and to the exploration of the relationship between linguistic structure, thought and the nature of embodied human experience. The following issues are the topics to be discussed: Language, Language and the Brain, Language Acquisition, the Mental Lexicon, the Representation of Language in the Mind
 
Models for the acquisition, processing, and application of human knowledge as the object of cognitive sciences. Cognitive linguistics as the investigation of the acquisition, processing, and application of language knowledge. Grammar as a model of human language knowledge. Relations to artificial intelligence.

## Entry 1662

AEE331: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING. The main objective of this course is to familiarize the students with the basic 3 heat transfer modes, namely conduction, convection and radiation, which are common in aerospace systems. The students are also equipped with the ability to identify the existing heat transfer mode(s) on a given problem, and then to analyze the problem by determining the involved heat transfer rates or temperature distributions. The relevant system of equations or differential equations is formed simply by the conservation of energy principle applied to a control volume of finite size or differential size. Following the introduction of Fourier's law for heat conduction, and derivation of the general heat diffusion equation in three dimensions, equations are simplified for one-dimensional problems. Applications to plane walls, with and without thermal energy generation (heat sources), extended bodies (fins), and non-uniform cross sections with quasi one-dimensional approach are made. The concept of equivalent thermal circuit and thermal resistance to conduction heat transfer is introduced. While solving one-dimensional conduction problems with convection over a surface and/or radiation, Newton's law of cooling for convection heat transfer that develops across the thermal boundary layer and/or the black body radiation formula are used for providing the necessary boundary condition at the surface. Following one-dimensional problems, an analytical solution method is taught for treating two-dimensional linear conduction problems without volumetric heat generation. Fundamental knowledge for drawing constant temperature lines (isotherms) and heat flow lines (adiabats) is also provided to appreciate heat transfer phenomena across 2-D bodies. Transient conduction is treated analytically for complex shapes using the lumped capacitance method, and for simple shapes with 1-D conduction solving the full diffusion equation. The use of the non-dimensional Biot number is explained in transient conduction problems. The convection heat transfer mode is observed extensively in aerospace applications. Regarding this heat transfer mode, the fundamental physics pertaining to it is discussed first. For this velocity and thermal boundary layer equations are derived, and then non-dimensionalized, leading to the definitions of the Reynolds number, Prandtl number. By equating the conduction heat transfer at the surface but on the fluid side to convection heat transfer definition the so-called Nusselt number is obtained and this is shown to equal nothing but the fluid's dimensionless temperature gradient at the surface. Both analytical and experimental functions are given for the Nusselt number for various flow configurations. Internal flow convection problems are also treated. Free convection is shown to exist when gravitational effects are important. Relevant dimensionless parameters are discussed and Nusselt number correlations are given for some simple configurations, such as flat plate and horizontal infinite cylinder.  Fundamental concepts of radiation heat transfer are taught. 
 
Basic concepts. One-dimensional steady-state conduction, extended surfaces, two-dimensional steady-state conduction, shape factors, transient conduction.  Forced convection, Reynolds analogy, convection for external and internal flows.  Free convection, boiling and condensation, heat exchangers.  Radiation heat transfer between surfaces.

## Entry 1760

CE241: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING. All engineers are concerned with the structural safety, serviceability and the economics of the constructions with which they are involved. The successful approach to the problem can only be established through a sound knowledge of computational methods of engineering and a thorough understanding of the properties and behavior of engineering materials. Without a proper knowledge of materials neither the structural safety and serviceability nor the economics can be achieved in engineering projects. The purpose of this course is to emphasize the basic principles necessary for an understanding of the fundamental nature and properties of engineering materials and to make clear the significance of these principles in engineering practice. The objective has been to present a unified treatment of a variety of materials, stressing the fundamentals which provide a common basis for explaining the behavior of the varied materials. The organization of the course material is such that, first, the elements of the atomic and electronic structure of matter are introduced and the structure types of solids are explained. Then, the physicochemical aspects of the colloidal material used in industrial practice are covered.  A sequence proceeds from atomic structures to coarser structures, from the simple to the more complex. Such a sequence from atoms to crystals, to phases, to microstructures and to macrostructures is followed because the grosser structures and properties depend on the finer structural characteristics. Considering the importance of the mechanical behavior of materials and the limitation of the course period, emphasis is given to the phenomena associated with the mechanical behavior of the materials and their structural characteristics. Elasticity, plasticity and flow phenomena are explained by reference to the main types of engineering materials and a discussion of the strength and other related properties of the materials follows. Finally the effect of radiation damage on the mechanical properties of materials is briefly discussed.
 
Engineering requirements of materials; the structure of matter; atomic arrangements, structural imperfections, atom movements. Mechanical properties. Concepts of force, stress, deformation and strain; elasticity; elastic and plastic behavior; viscosity; rheological models. Creep, relaxion, brittleness, ductility, hardness, fatigue, toughness, resilience, and damping characteristics of materials.

## Entry 1801

CE446: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING. Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. lt literally forms the basis of modern society. There is scarcely any aspect of daily life which does not depend directly or indirectly on concrete. Therefore, the properties of this material need to be known very well. In order to know and realize the importance of properties and the behavior of concrete, the properties of the materials that compose the concrete need to be known as well. The CE students of METU meet with cement and aggregate to a certain extent in their second year course, CE 244 Materials of construction, which includes many other construction materials such as metals, wood, clay products, building stones, lime, gypsum, etc. Due to the time limitation, such aspects as quality of mixing water and the types of admixtures used for concrete are not taught in CE 344. There is no other course for the CE students related to the concrete making materials during their BS program. During their brief study of cement and aggregate in the second year, the students usually do not realize the importance of these materials and they graduate without any further knowledge of their characteristics. Therefore, this course on “Concrete-Making Materials” is planned to furnish the fourth year students the necessary information on cements, aggregates, water and admixtures. Those students who will have the opportunity to take such a course will not only learn these materials but also properly to evaluate their importance from the technical and economic viewpoints.
 
Properties of fresh concrete: Workability, consistency, bleeding, stiffening, setting, air-entrainment, unit weight, uniformity, batching, mixing, conveying, placing, compaction and curing.

CE447: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING. All civil engineers are concerned with the structural safety, serviceability and the economics of the constructions with which they are involved. The successful approach to the problem can only be established through a sound knowledge of computational methods of engineering and a thorough understanding of the properties and behavior of engineering materials. Without a proper knowledge of materials neither the structural safety and serviceability nor the economics can be achieved in civil engineering projects. Two compulsory courses on materials are given to the second year civil engineering students. (CE 241- Materials Science and CE 344-Materials of Construction). However, since there is a vast variety of construction materials, appropriate and detailed information for all the important materials cannot be included in the regular contents of the above two courses. The CE 447 - Advanced Materials of Construction course intends to include subjects such as properties of alloy steels, structural steel products, precast concrete blocks, brick, tile, wood products, polymers and adhesives that are vitally important in civil engineering but cannot be covered in the CE 344 - Materials of Construction course.

## Entry 1868

CENG280: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER ENGINEERING. Computer Science needs mathematical languages to abstract away from particulars of computing machinery and to concentrate on systematicity, capacity, and efficiency of computing in the abstract. Theory of formal languages studies such languages while automata theory studies their acceptors. Both theories have found scientific and practical use in all areas of computer science and engineering. In fact, description of any computational process can be recast in formal language theory or automata theory. From this perspective, the theory can be seen as a vehicle for communicating the ideas clearly and precisely among computer scientists.
This course is an introduction to the topic.
 
Introduction to strings, languages and grammars. Concept of abstract machines and language acceptance. Deterministic and non-deterministic finite state machines. Regular expressions. Machines with pushdown tape. Turing Machines and recursive functions.

PHIL215: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. No objective 
Many of the philosophical schools of antiquity saw philosophy as the ´art of living´ rather than merely teaching abstract theory or the exegesis of texts. Philosophical practice is an attempt by philosophers to return philosophy to its ancient and practical roots. The course, therefore, is an inquiry into the role of philosophy in our daily life. For this purpose ideas of of great philosophers from Pythagoras to Postmodenism are discussed and moral, aesthetic and political implications of their views of philosophy and practice are studied and criticized.

## Entry 1917

PHIL235: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Logic is the study of "good" reasoning. We all have some basic intuitions about what counts as "good" or "acceptable" reasoning, but those intuitions fail most of the time, especially in cases where reasoning is more complex. Logic is the discipline that formalizes those intuitions so that the failure of distinguishing "good" reasoning from "bad" reasoning is minimized. In this course, we will study one of the two main types of logic, i.e. deductive logic (the other being inductive logic). The topics  that will be covered are validity, soundness, truth-table methods, natural deduction proof techniques and some metatheorems. The course will be useful for any student who aims to improve his/her analytical thinking skills.

PHIL351: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. At the end of this course, students will have gained knowledge of classical ethical theories and will be able to apply them to contemporary moral problems.
 
The course will begin with consideration of various arguments encountered in everyday life of ethical or moral issues: Is the death penalty a morally acceptable type of punishment? Is the censorship of pornography ethically justified? What are our moral obligations with respect to the environment and what is the appropriate moral foundation for those obligations?. After developing some skill in identifying ethical and moral arguments and disagreement on such issues, major ethical theories such as utilitarianism, Kantianism,    egoism, etc., will be applied to these moral problems. In order to fulfill this aim, several concrete and pressing moral problems will be chosen. The student will be encouraged to write and think clearly about these problems, weighing alternative solutions and criticising those which are weak and untenable. The main focus will be to give the student the skill necessary to identify a moral problem and to introduce her to critical thinking over moral issues.

PHIL352: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. When studying a philosophical position, it may be very hard, and even inappropriate to make a distinction between the content of the philosophical position and its form or better the activity itself. However, it can be done so for a pedagogical reason: to learn about the tool-box of philosophical constructions. Moreover, it is a good philosophical practice –yes there is a hidden agenda- because all this boils down to a simple question: what does it mean to engage philosophical practice?

Important note:  If you are not a philosophy major, you may be allowed to take this course but only if you have taken at least several philosophy (or humanties / social sciences) courses before.  Consult with me if you intend to take the course so that I can assess if your background is adequate.
This course is about pragmatism which emerged as a philosophical school in the USA about a century ago and is currently regarded as one of the most influential philosophical perspectives or approaches now.  We will take a look at the original defenders of this movement and then consider some of its more recent proponents.  Our aim is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of pragmatism vis-a-vis its ontological and epistemological aspects and also with regard to its social-political implications.  We will also try to evaluate pragmatism from a broader philosophical perspective, asking the question of how pragmatism views philosophy as an intellectual discipline.  To that end we will focus on Richard Rorty's ideas on truth and the identity of philosophy.  We will discuss Rorty's reading of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and evaluate his controversial construal of Orwell and related ideas.
 
A study of American Pragmatism and its influence on contemporary cultural/intellectual life. Study of the founders of the pragmatist movement such as Charles S. Peirce, William James and John Dewey, the pragmatist critigue of the epistemological and ontological traditions, pragmatism s reaction to intellectual tendencies in philosophy, possible precursors of pragmatists in the 19th century (such as F. Nietzsche), pragmatists views on knowledge, scientific endeavor, morality, social progress, education, and democracy, more recent representatives of pragmatism such as Richard Rorty, the connection between pragmatism and liberalism and totalitarianism, traditional and contemporary reactions to pragmatism, the controversy about pragmatism s position in the philosophical debate between realism and anti-realism.

ENVE494: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF Environmental Engineering. This course aims to focus on global challenges facing environmental engineers in the twenty-first century. The course will call upon technical knowledge senior students have gained over the course of the first three years of their education and use this knowledge and their ideas initially to identify and investigate major environmental challenges facing the world, and then grasp and devise ways to contribute to the solution process. From a perspective of holistic engineering education, this course will help actively contextualize the environmental engineer’s role in global debates using a whole systems approach; by integrating in-depth technical knowledge on environmental problems and solutions with topics that provide breadth such as social responsibility, policy and entrepreneurial thinking.  By this approach and exposure to global issues, engineering expertise can be put to use on complex environmental, social, energy, economic and technical challenges of the twenty first century.
Through relevant course components (i.e. reading assignments, weekly tasks, discussion hours) students will obtain information and find opportunity to create innovative solutions regarding pressing challenges that the world currently faces and be able to form opinions on these issues from a variety of perspectives. Guest lectures are planned to bring together students with professionals working on such global challenges. Presentations as well as discussion hours involving invited guests will provide an interactive environment in the classroom for fruitful discussions.
As opposed to the specific challenges in the field of environmental engineering such as treatment of a particular type of pollutant from wastewater or a gaseous emission, this course aims to provide a larger scale, global framework on environmental issues which will enable a wider perspective for students regarding global problems that the world faces. In such challenges, there may not be one single solution, or approach by professionals of one or two disciplines. Here, environmental engineers are desperately needed to contribute to and perhaps act as the leader for devising solutions in a multi-disciplinary environment.

Each nation has its own types of fermented food, representing the staple diet and the raw ingredients available in that particular place. Although the products are well know to the individual, they may not be associated with fermentation. Indeed, it is likely that the methods of producing many of the worlds fermented foods are unknown and came about by chance. Some of the more obvious fermented fruit and vegetable products are the alcoholic beverages - beers and wines. However, several more fermented fruit and vegetable products arise from lactic acid fermentation and are extremely important in meeting the nutritional requirements of a large proportion of the worlds population. The student will be able to assess the beneficial microorganisms that control the course of fermentation
