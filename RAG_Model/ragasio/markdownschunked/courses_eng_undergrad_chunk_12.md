SOC382: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. This course is about the dynamics of family, marriage, kinship relations, lineage, and patriarchal structures in Turkey. It is based on classic anthropological and sociological texts written by Western and Turkish scholars that students should read and rely on since these texts allow us to better understand and comprehend the debates on Turkish modernization. The tension or conflict between traditionalism and modernization with an emphasis on the gender dimension of the process of modernization in Turkey is another theme of the course. This course is also about the multiple methods of data collection and methodological approaches in the fields of sociology and social anthropology. Overall, the course will help the students to trace the tension between cultural, ideological and political thinking in the context of Turkish modernization.
 
The Structural transformation of late Ottoman society within the context of the new global economic and political order; the Western challenge and  the  response  of the  Ottoman  state; new social forces   within  late  Ottoman  society;  and Jeune Turc ideology and its roots. Following this framework, the process of nation-state building in Turkey is discussed with reference to various forms of resistance movements and formal political opposition experienced between the years of 1919 and the early 1940s. The ideology of nationalism and nation building is emphasized.

Introduce students to the research in environmental sociology and to emphasize how a sociological perspective can inform our understanding of changes in the natural world. Although environmental sociology encompasses a large and growing literature, the course will focus upon several prominent works and will introduce students to the fundamental issues and debates in the field.
Promote students’ ability to evaluate the existing research and to understand its implications. Class discussions, lectures, writing assignments, and the final paper will all help in the realization of this goal.
Promote the development of a global perspective on environmental issues. Just as processes of environmental and social change are linked, developments originating in isolated regions often have worldwide implications. Conversely, global trends are often particularly manifest in specific locales. This course will attempt to make those critical connections evident.
Enhance students’ writing and research abilities. Toward this end, each student in the course will complete regular writing assignments and a research paper.

 
Environmental sociology is a field of inguiry that focuses on the relationship between society and the biophysical environment. This course will consider social relationships at both the global and local levels, as well as in urban and rural localities. It examines how human societies affect the environment and how human societies are shaped by the environment.

SOC417: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. This course examines and compares cultures through materials and practices embedded in everyday life with anthropological perspectives.  One of the most important subjects of everyday life is food.  Food is more than sustenance; it is our lifestyle, a nexus among people, it brings memories and nostalgia.  Through food we create and present our identities (e.g., national, regional, religious, ethnic, gender and class); for example, tamales are significant food among Mexicans and South Americans.  Does it follow that the consumption of tamales signifies regionalism or nationalism?  Are all pizza Italian?  Is pizza served at American franchised restaurants Italian or American cuisine?  Is barbeque for men more than for women and sweets for women more than men?  How do people feel nostalgic for foreign originated food?  Do people consume no meat for good health or for political statement?  The relationships between food and people are complex.  And, it is an individual researcher’s goal to discover, analyze and interpret the complexity.
By exploring foodways—the traditions and customs in production, consumption and distribution of food—of others and ours, we will learn the different ways of using food to create and present identities; how and in what circumstances people use food to distinguish them from one another as well as connect with others?  How do they recreate new identities or diminish old ones in order to be accepted in new places or by new people?  The primary goal of this course is to develop a critical awareness of cultural similarities as much as differences.  Throughout the course, you should always ask yourself: What is culture? 
We study food as an academic subject through readings, films and class/group discussions.  There are no right and wrong opinions as each of us have a different background, which has shaped our perspectives.  However, you should be thinking about food in terms of anthropology.  As a final project, you will do a food-based research paper—to examine food of other culture rather than your own, such as outside your region, ethnicity, religion, class, and gender.  In your paper, you should pose a central research question, for example, “How do people in America present their class identity through sushi consumption?” or “How is simit significant to everyday life in Turkey?”  By examining the ways by which others shape their identity through food, you learn about their culture and people.  This helps you to be self-reflective with your own culture as well.  In your research paper, you should discuss how a particular food impacts people’s everyday life and the ways by which they form their identities. 
 
The course probes such social and cultural questions as  ´Are there different kinds of rationality? ´,  ´Does language limit and control thought? ´,  ´What kind of difficulties arise when we attempt to translate from one language, or culture, into another?,  ´Are there universal moral principles? ´,  ´Is it possible to compare different cultures? ´ Basic concepts such as self, reason and sanity, money and wealth, religious beliefs, and health will be subjected to critique.

SOC427: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. The course examines the formation and dynamics of ethnic groups in the contemporary world. It surveys major topics, theoretical definitions/debates and approaches in the field of race and ethnicity. Moreover, it also examines social and ethnic relations as part of larger social systems by emphasizing the relationship between ethnicity on the one hand and nations, state, class, minority groups, gender, power, and politics on the other.
 
The aim of the course is to provide academic background, conceptual clarity, and guidance to the students around the key concepts of race and ethnicity. Classical studies on nationalism and state-formation emphasize territoriality, clearly delimited boundaries, and a homogenous population with a focus on universalism, inclusion, civility, modern tolerance, transnational integration and civic nationhood. The increasing emphasis on particularity, exclusion, violence, ancient hatreds, and national disintegration (stemming mainly from the post-communist east Europe and the former Soviet Union and the increasing number of immigrants in Europe) constitutes a challenge to the analytical gains of the mainstream literature on nationalism. In this context ethnic group formation, ethnic integration and ethnic conflict appear among the defining phenomena of the modern era. While one understanding in the field of race and ethnicity emphasizes membership in definite groups (similarity), the other emphasizes cultural differentiation (difference); both aiming to explain and understand human diversity through the processes of social identification and interaction. Ethnic integration and ethnic conflict can be divided into several sub-categories, such as assimilation, melting pot or cultural pluralism (multiculturalism) on the one hand and discrimination, ethnic cleansing or genocide on the other. Since ethnic groups can (and often do) generate various forms of conflict, ethnicity appears as one of the most controversial topics in the literature. Most theoretical approaches to understanding racial and ethnic identification or racial and ethnic relations remain inconclusive. Thus, it is important to emphasize a broader understanding of the concept of ethnicity as a social phenomenon. Ethnicity also has political, historical, economic, and religious dimensions none of which can be ignored. In this context, conceptions like “the return of the repressed” or “elite manipulation” need to be critically reconsidered in relation to the concepts of collective identity (and its expressive forms) and (ethnic and racial) social movements.

SOC428: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. The aim of this course is to study on the subject of city culture in the global world within a framework of  interdisciplinary approach and develop some field methods and put them in application in order to enable students to explore different aspects of the city culture that they live in.
 
Exploration of the cultures of cities requires to ask a series of questions: How do cities use culture? Who plays a leading role in the formation of cities’ cultures? Who controls the “symbolic economy” of the cities as Zukin (1994) uses the term? Who really occupy the central spaces of cities? Which components of a city life are essential for the formation of city cultures? How does the history of a city play a role in the formation of its current cultural characteristics? How are the city cultures embodied by its inhabitants and which inhabitants embody which characteristics of  city cultures? In short how the cultures of cities are produced, consumed and reproduced by whom? And finally how all these questions can be applied to Ankara, the capital of Turkey. 
 
City Culture in the global world with an interdisciplinary world with an interdisciplinary approach: field methods and their application on different aspects of the city culture throughout different socio-economic and political periods; Ankara as the capital of Turkey and city culture in Ankara and Turkish modernization.

SOC466: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. Course Description
This is a reading and writing intensive seminar on human beings’ universal metabolic relationship with the rest of nature and the manifold historical-geographical forms this relationship takes. Moving from the European colonial expansion and the Caribbean transnationalism as a starting point of problematization, our discussion will often revolve broadly around the intersection of political economy and political ecology. We will critically discuss such issues as the relational and intersecting processes of appropriation of nature through human labor, the production of space and social ecologies; appropriation of labor’s surplus by the owners of the means of production; and the relational and transnational formation of social identities such as race, ethnicity, and gender through a historical perspective both in colonial and post-colonial contexts across the globe.
Course Objectives:

To introduce and debate the relationality among the labor regimes, surplus extraction, land ownership systems and the construction of various social identities along different axes of social difference such as race, gender, ethnicity, and nationality.
To problematize and discuss the differences between, imperialism, transnationalism, colonialism, post-colonialism, nationalism, and universalism through a historical materialist framework by specifically examining class formations, land ownership and labor regimes in the context of the emergence and consolidation of European political modernity.
To discuss how above-mentioned processes are integral to the production of socio-ecological environments various peoples lived in and the historical formation of contemporary globalized political-ecological issues.

Attending the seminar: 1 point each week (14 Points in Total)
Attending the discussion: 6 Points in total
Inasmuch as you are free to come and go to our seminars as you like as free individuals, this course will evaluate your ability to bring your bodies and ideas into the classroom. There is a reason for such tyranny: The true gift of seminars is its collectivity, or what Marx calls “the natural advantages of cooperation” in the production process. It is in the classroom where we have a chance to express the way we read texts, hear others’ way of reading them, and challenge ourselves and our fellow readers in a fruitful collective environment.
Honest intellectual engagement in class discussions is, after all, the most challenging demand this course will impose on you.   
 
Critical Discussion Leading (10%) 
Throughout the semester each of you will spin-off the in-class discussion with a presentation that should take 10-to-15-minutes. If the number of students exceed 13, this presentation can be done in pairs, in which case the two parts of the presentation should not exceed 20 minutes in total. You are expected to critically review the assignments of the week, lay down the main arguments and major points of discussion and put them into a dialogue with each other and the other texts of the syllabus whenever possible. Note that this excludes simple summaries. The primary aim of this exercise is to encourage you to construct a productive intellectual engagement with the assigned texts rather than being passive recipients. The experience from the past few semesters shows that it becomes very productive when you come up with critical questions derived from the text(s) to enrich your presentation. This enables us to pick up those questions to facilitate the discussion. When there are multiple texts in a particular week, you are expected to cover all the assigned readings and metabolize them in a single presentation.
Note that the presentations that are unable to lay down the main arguments and crucial points of discussion in 15 minutes (20 if there are two presenters) and take longer are subject to point loss. It is an important skill to be able structure your talk in a time that is allocated to you, be it 5 minutes, 15 minutes or more. It is possible to identify the main arguments and major points of discussion of any text in 15 minutes, unless you try to summarize it.   
Reading Notes (21%)
Throughout the semester you will write two-page response papers to seven weekly assignments of your choice. Each will account for 3% of your final grade. The principles of discussion leading applies to the notes as well. I would like you to critically discuss the assigned texts but given that you have two pages, you are encouraged to pick a point or two that you identify as interesting, important or vital for understanding the texts. You may again put these points into a dialogue with other texts of the course whenever possible. Note that this excludes simple summaries. The papers should be uploaded to turn-it-in until midnight on Tuesdays in order to facilitate the in-class discussion the next day. Since late papers would defeat this purpose, they will not be evaluated.
You should come prepared to make those points and be able to defend them in the classroom when necessary.
Term Paper (50%)
You will submit a final paper at the end of the semester. Your term paper topic is entirely up to you, i.e., you can problematize any aspect of this course, as long as it inspires you, be it theoretical/conceptual or empirical. You can consult me anytime if you are not sure how your intended paper topic could address the debates covered throughout the semester. No matter what your topic is about, I expect you to construct your research topic, produce clear research questions, which will then determine the literature you will review in order to situate your paper and your arguments. This holistic and relational methodology/epistemology will be part of our discussions throughout the semester, which will help you with the construction of your paper.
Your papers should be 15-20 pages. (Double-spaced, times new roman font, size 12.)
Academic dishonesty and the expropriation of labor of others in any form will not be tolerated. This is not because you have to respect the intellectual private property rights, but the labor of others.
 
The course explores the relational and intersecting processes of appropriation of nature through human labor, the production of space and social ecologies; appropriation of the surplus created by labor by the owners of the means of production; formation of social identities such as race, ethnicity and class through a historical perspective both in colonial and post-colonial contexts across the globe.

## Entry 969

SOC497: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. The question of secularism has become an issue of intense theoretical and political debate in recent decades. This is mostly due to a revival of religion as global fact. Recent developments such as fundamentalist upsurges (Islamic or Evangelical), the growing Muslim population in Western countries and the resurgence of religion in world affairs have put religion and secularism among the crucial issues for many Western and Eastern societies including Turkey. Thus, the issue of secularism has become a major research topic for sociologists. 
 
 
 
This course aims to acquaint students with the secularization debate. Enlightenment, secularizing effect of modernity, classical theories of secularization and recent approaches, different dimensions of secularization and Western secularisms will be critically analyzed. The development of secularism in different Western countries will be studied with a comparative perspective.

## Entry 970

SOC498: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. Secularism has become a subject of intense theoretical and political debate in recent decades. This is mostly due to a revival of religion as a global fact. Developments such as Islamic fundamentalist upsurges and the resurgence of religion in world affairs after the events of 9/11, and more recently, the formation of ISIS, the Charlie Hebdo attack have put religion and secularism among the crucial issues not only in Western societies but also in Muslim-minority and Muslim-majority societies including Turkey. These recent developments have also brought questions about free speech into sharp focus.
Decreasing commitment to traditional religions and the modern disconnection between faith communities and socio-cultural identities via the development of new religious movements are conducive to the development of fundamentalism. Also, individualization of faith and the disassociation of faith communities from ethnic and national identities are becoming widespread. In other words, the divide between culture and religion is growing as an important social fact and thus, attracting the attention of many sociologists.
Especially since the so called ‘war on terror’, the academic debate over the compatibility of Islam with secularism and democracy has become a subject of public discussion and thus, the issue of secularism a major research topic for sociologists. The main debates that the sociologists studying religion and secularism are engaged in, are as follows: The relationship between secularism/secular state and democracy; the place of Shari’a in Muslim societies; The relationship between Islam and the state throughout the history of Islam; the (im)possibility of realizing an ‘Islamic State’; the (possible) consequences of the coercive enforcement of Shari’a by the state; the threat of majoritarianism; the perception of Islamic upsurge in the West; the failure of the idea that we are living in a secular world, especially considering the limited secularization and secularism experienced in Muslim societies; the axiomatic nature of belief in the Muslim world as opposed to the West; attempts of creating a secular ethic and the difficulty in determining the principles of such ethic through a consensus; and the visibility of  religious markers in the public space have been hot topics for sociologists studying religion and secularism. 
The study of Muslim-minority and Muslim-majority societies, especially of the case of Turkey, will contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between Islam, secularization and the secular state; the increasingly important role that religion plays in these societies and the debates over the importance of secularism for the establishment of democratic political regimes.  
 
 
The principal aim of this course is to acquaint students with the secularization process, the secular state in predominantly Muslim societies and also in Muslim-minority states. Experience of secularization, laicité and secular state, and the relationship between Islam and politics will be critically and comparatively examined in different countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Egypt, Iran, Israel and Turkey.
