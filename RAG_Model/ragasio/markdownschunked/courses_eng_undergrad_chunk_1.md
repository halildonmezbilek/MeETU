ARCH104: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE. This course will be developed on three tracks and have the following objectives
Sketching: Similar to Arch103, you are asked to bring your sketchbooks to each studio class, and we will pursue our sketching sessions at the start of our classes. These sessions aim to furnish the students with an analytical vision to the formal aspects of the architectural products and drawing abilities to depict these formal characteristics in free hand.
Introduction of new projection systems and further applications of the ones covered in Arch 103:  Orthographic and paraline drawings are already covered and Perspective drawings will be studied in the second semester. Shades and shadows in all three of the projection sytems, composite drawings such as section-perspective, exploded or expanded drawings are amongst the further applications to be covered in spring.
Architectural Representation: The projection systems introduced in the fall and spring semesters are to be used in the term project: “Representation of a small building”. Students are expected to form groups in order to represent architecture and to get acquainted with its basic drawing conventions, norms and scales of the profession. A small building in the university campus will be analyzed and drawn in various techniques by the students. Conceptual and architectural models will be constructed as a group work. Besides equipping the students with technical facets of graphic communication, this term project is to be conceived as a hands-on introduction into the culture of architecture.
 
Analytical study and  presentation of natural and man-made environments. Analysis of part/whole, figure/ground, form/structure, mass/space, form/function relations. Emphasis given to analytical drawings of architectural forms chosen among historical and contemporary examples.

ARCH322: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE. No objective 
Focusing on the major movements and artists of the post-war period, this course allows students to learn methods, tools, and terminologies to critically analyze contemporary art in relation to social and historical context, critical debates, new media, and the changing role of the spectator/participant. Not only does the art production postdating World War II raise the questions of what art is or can be, but it is also concerned with endless possible ways in which the audiences can experience art. Contemporary art employs a range of new materials and technologies, questions the validity of intentionality and authorship, and addresses previously excluded audiences. It invades non-art spaces, blurs the boundaries between text and image, document and performance, asks questions about institutional frames (the museum, gallery, and art journal), and generates new forms of criticism. Much of the canon of what counts as important is still in flux, especially for the last twenty years. And the stage is no longer centered only on the United States and Europe but is becoming increasingly global.

ARCH324: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE. The aim is to be familiarized students with architectural writing strategies, research skills, critical evaluation of architectural texts, and methods of incorporating background research in thinking on architecture in terms of reading and understanding an academic article. The structure of the course is centered on the process of preparing and writing an academic short article on a chosen topic – based on individual feedback.
 
The course intends to improve students` skills in the practice of thinking in terms of reading and writing by emphasizing the significance of this practice in the process of architectural production. In a movement from simpler to complex reading and writing, it aims to acquaint students with basic and advanced strategies in the analysis, synthesis and critique of architectural texts (texts, acting as the medium through which these strategies are developed, are selected to overlap within a contextual framework and renewed each year). In this sense, the course attempts to play a preparatory role for advanced courses on history, theory and criticism that demand these strategies intensively in the practice of thinking on architecture.

• The major theoretical perspectives on social classes and their relevance to the study of politics
• The major modes of working class organizations, actions, and ideologies
• The emergence and development of the working class in historical perspective
• The general and distinctive conditions of the development of the working class in Ottoman and Republican Turkey
• The major trends in working class organizations, actions, legislations, and ideologies in Turkey
• The impacts of the scientific-technological revolution, the third crisis of capitalism, and globalization on the working class movement in the world and in Turkey
• The effects of the capitalist restoration of the etatist-bureaucratic socialism on the working class movement
 
The rationale for re-proposing of this course is may social scientifically grounded opinion of felt need for integration of a course –indeed a series of courses- focused on the development of the working class in Turkey to the undergraduate curriculum of our department in order to stimulate the development of an awareness of the necessity of grounding the academic formation of political science students on the reality and knowledge of social classes as the broadest and deepest socio-historical determining bases of politics in class societies. In the first part of the treatment of the proposed course subjects, a preliminary introduction to the major theoretical perspectives on social classes; the major modes of working class organizations, actions and ideologies; and a brief history of the emergence and development of the working class will be realized. However, the main focus of the course will be an exploration of the general and distinctive conditions of the development of the working class, and the major trends in the working class organizations, actions legislations and ideologies in the Ottoman and Republican Turkey in an integrated perspective. Three other areas of the focuses of the treatment of the subject will be on the macro-societal conditions of the working class at the Dawn of the Twenty-first Century: (1) the impacts of the scientific-technological revolution, (2) the third crisis of capitalism, and its neo-liberal global restructuration (globalization of capitalism) and (3) the capitalist restoration of the etatist-bureauctarictic socialism on the working class movement in the world in general and in Turkey particular.
