Question: I have problems with VPN services, what can I do?
Answer: 

If you have problems with installing the Aruba VIA software, please visit https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/i-have-problems-installing-vpn-services-w...
If you have problems with connecting to the VPN service, please check the following settings:
Make sure that you have the version of Aruba VIA installed on your system is the same as the one available from https://netregister.metu.edu.tr . There may be an update to the version you are using. After downloading the new version, follow the steps at http://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/groups/vpn-service matching your operating system to setup Aruba VIA.
If you end up with "... has stopped working" Windows error message when you try to run Aruba VIA software, there might be a problem with the software installation or a different problem with the operating system. For this problem, you can follow the resolutions suggested from this link. 
For each connection, you need to provide your usercode and password. If the Aruba VIA application does not ask for your usercode and password, please try clearing the profile of Aruba VIA. You can follow the steps at http://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/groups/vpn-service matching your operating system to setup Aruba VIA.
Your network provider might be blocking the communication ports Aruba VIA needs to use. The ports Aruba VIA uses are 443 and 4500. (UDP:  500, 1701, 4500 TCP: 1723, 443, IP protocol: 50 are also used for MACOS) You can contact the IT department of your network provider to make sure that these ports are not blocked.
Any antivirus or firewall applications installed on your computer might also block VPN connections or cause the application not to install. In such a case, please uninstall both the VPN and the antivirus/firewall applications and restart your computer. Then, you can try installing Aruba VPN. If you can establish the connection, you can install the antivirus after the VPN application. (During our trials, in Windows 10 64 bit running Symantec Endpoint protection, even if the real-time protection is disabled, the VPN application and setup failed. With both Symantec and Aruba VPN uninstalled and then only Aruba VPN installed, VPN connection can be established)
If you cannot see the Aruba Via driver in the Device Manager / Network adapters, it means that the setup of Aruba VPN is not complete and VPN might not work as expected. In such a case please uninstall and try installing Aruba VIA again and make sure that Aruba Via Driver is working properly in Device Manager.
You can only connect to the VPN service with the clients available from https://netregister.metu.edu.tr/ and for the listed operating systems. Due to the protocols used, you cannot connect to the VPN service with the utilities built-in the operating system or any other third party clients. If there is not an Aruba VPN client available, you can connect to the VPN via other devices till a version compatible with your operating system becomes available.
Even after trying the above recommended solutions, please open an issue via https://itsupport.metu.edu.tr/

## Entry 2575

Question: Is there a wireless network in METU, how can I connect?
Answer: 

History of Wireless Network in METU
Middle East Technical University Computer Center has been the first to deploy wireless network among Turkish universities. This network was setup in point-to-point mode with 802.11b standard. Four distant departments / administrative units were connected using this method.
A set of wireless connection equipment was set a side for emergency cases, in case the connection of a department might be damaged and there would be a need of immideate connection. This set was used a couple of times to connect the department/unit whose connection was damaged, to the backbone network temporarily until the connection is reestablihed conventioanlly.
Later in year 2003, the first workgroup mode wireless network was established at the top of Central Engineering Building for enabling mobile clients' connectivity to Internet.
The present of Wireless Network in METU
In year 2005, with the increase in number of the wireless clients, the coverage area of the workgroup wireless network METU had been expanded to cover nearly the whole departments and administrative units. In every department and unit, hot spots for mobile users had been determined and these spots had been covered with wireless networks by setting up 802.11g access points. Now there is at least one wireless coverage area in every department and in addition to these, part of the dormitories, all academic residences, all the halls of the Library and the Cultural and Convention Center, and the guest houses are under coverage. To see the map of the wireless network points in METU you can take a look this map.
There is currently at least one SSID broadcast in every AP (ng2k broadcast, which is available without any encryption, ended in 2018 and meturoam has started). There is also a second SSID broadcast (namely eduroam) from that runs with 802.1x and that's a part of the EDUROAM, which stands for Education Roaming. EDUROAM runs on a RADIUS-based infrastructure that uses 802.1X security technology to allow for inter-institutional roaming. For more information about this network and the details of how to set it, please go to eduroam page.
Users without a wireless network interface card can borrow cards from the Library and Cultural and Convention Center with their ID cards. Unfortunately this service is available to METU students and personnel only. These cards are introduced to the authentication system beforehand and needn't to be registered.
People visiting METU can use the wireless service at Cultural and Convention Centre and guest houses by registering their MAC addresses. This is going to be temporary registeration and will be deleted after a predetermined time.

Question: It seems I have a connection to the wireless network but I can't connect to the Internet. What should I do?
Answer: 

Wireless network connection problems are observed in some of Android devices using Android 6 and prior versions. Occasionally these devices display there is an established wireless connection on the screen but when you try to connect to the Internet, they fail. This problem is originated from a bug in the operating system. The bug cause Android devices to continue to use DHCP-leased IP addresses after the leases expire, and cause Android devices to resume using IP addresses from expired DHCP leases. When you face the the same problem please disable your Wi-Fi connection and enable it again.

## Entry 2578

Question: My internet connection is very slow. What could be the problem?
Answer: 

If your wireless internet connection is slow, you can review the following items;
- Use of wrong modeled and outdated wireless ethernet card driver- Use of shields to cover the antennas of mobile devices or computers (especially metal ones)- Use of computer or device far away from the wireless access point (distance and intervening obstacles will reduce performance)- Having internet access in places with high user density (performance will decrease as the number of users on the wireless network access point increases). When using a wireless network, if possible, places with fewer users around can be preferred.- Unnecessary applications that make download/upload operations when using a wireless network (for example, downloading files while using Zoom)- Meturoam/Eduroam are virtual wireless network broadcasts and both are broadcast from physically the same wireless network devices. Some devices may experience problems because they use different crypto technologies. Alternatively, a connection can be attempted with the other.- Metuconnect is a network open for authorization only and does not provide an Internet connection. You can only reach netregister.metu.edu.tr via this network. After completing your authorization procedures, you need to stop using it by "forget this network". Staying connected to this network will cause you to experience Internet problems.- Staying between two similar broadcasts can cause connection problems, as mobile devices in wireless networks "roam" in a way that prefers the better one among the available broadcasts. Moving closer to one, if possible, will help eliminate these problems.- Current wifi technologies operate in the 2.4 and 5Ghz bands. 2.4Ghz performs much better in terms of wall throughput and distance. But considering the bandwidth and the number of users, 5Ghz works much better. If the features of your device are suitable, you can check which one you are connecting from. In some devices, one may be given priority or the device may be forced to use only one of them. In cases where you are close to a wireless network access device, providing a 5Ghz connection will increase performance. If you are far away from the device or there are walls in between, setting 2.4Ghz will provide a more stable connection.
The slowness of your wired/wireless network connection speed may be due to any of the issues mentioned in the control items above. In addition, the connection speed may be slow due to the problem with your computer (problems with your network interface card, virus, etc.).
When it is said "I have a problem with my internet speed", it is very important to define the problem correctly for a solution. Information such as the page trying to connect, the device used during the connection (operating system and MAC/IP address information), the connection time interval, the connected user code are very important for a quick solution. The address https://speedtest.metu.edu.tr/ can be used to detect the slowness of the connection speed and see the instant speed.

a. Peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing programs, as well as violating copyright and licensing rules, use up an excessive amount of bandwidth that consequently hinders the use of network resources for purposes of priority. For this reason, it is strictly forbidden to use the "peer-to-peer" file sharing programs - even if they are used inside the campus network. Such usage includes, but is not limited to, the following programs:
b. It is expressly forbidden to use wireless network resources for commercial purposes or for activities of personal gain.
c. It is forbidden to use wireless network resources for mass mailing, mail bombing, sending spam and users are not allowed to provide the means to the third parties to perform similar acts.
d. It is prohibited to keep possession of server computers that provide internet service (web hosting service, e-mail service etc.) via wireless network.
e. Users must not intentionally allow others to use University network resources from outside or, in other words, users must not pave the way for others to exploit privileges and act as if they are authorized to own the legitimate rights of the University users. (proxy, relay, IP sharer, NAT etc.)
f. It is forbidden to commit activities that threaten the security of the network (DoS attack, port-network scan etc.)
g. Users are definitely not allowed to change the hardware address (MAC address) of wireless network interface. This address is only to be handled and verified to the authentication system of METU Computer Center (CC) by the CC Network Group. If changing the MAC address is inescapably required (as in the cases of breakdown or failure of wireless network access card etc.) users must certainly report it to Computer Center to carry out the proper procedure for that change. (The computer will not gain access to the wireless network, unless its new MAC address is authenticated by the authentication system).
h. Wireless network facilities of the University (network connection, user codes, local/off-campus access etc.), which are granted as a privilege to the University members, will be used by every user in an appropriate, legal, ethical and considerate manner in accordance with the codes of behaviour and the regulations. It is the sole responsibility of all users that they are not endangering the safety of the resources by providing intentionally or unintentionally the means tothe third parties to access to network resources. The user alone is answerable and accountable for every unlawful and unwanted consequences that may result from this act.
3. If the use of the compurting and networking facilities is proven to be incompatible with the educational and scholarly missions of the University, and if the user has been proven to behave irresponsibly, inappropriately and illegally in a manner displaying disruptive and inappropriate conduct that endanger the efficiency, integrity, safety and continuity of networking services; and if the user breaches the rules and regulations set forth in this document, one or more of the following disciplinary actions may be taken as a reasonable response to eliminate threatening and abusive behaviour;
local and/or off-campus network access privileges may be restricted,
local and/or off-campus network access privileges may be suspended, modified or witheld,
the user codes and user accounts on the central server systems may be terminated,
University's disciplinary mechanisms such as investigation or prosecution may be initiated, judicial proceedings may be started,
4. the student, who has been proven to have disregarded or violated the rules and regulations, will be forewarned the departmental secretary.
5. These rules and regulations become effective as soon as they are publicized. The University and Computer Center reserves the right to amend these Rules and Regulations at any time without prior notice. The updated version of the rules and regulations can be viewed at this web address.
NOTICE of DISCLAIMER:
METU CC does not accept any responsibility of the risks that arise from utilization of the wireless network. All responsibility belongs to the user.

Question: I cannot get in/out at the electronic card pass system of the departments. What should I do?
Answer: 


If the card reader does not give a ‘beep’ warning even though you hold the card from a few centimeters distance of the card reader with the METU logo, it means that there is a physical problem with your card. If you are a METU staff, apply to the Directorate of Personnel Affairs, if you are a METU student apply to the Student Affairs Office where you can have your card checked and you can apply for a new card if it is necessary.



If the card reader gives a ‘beep’ warning but the door does not open, then there may be a problem with your authorization. You can apply to the authorization officer of your department and have your authorization checked for access. 
The access authorization is granted by the department officer(s) and you can get information about your authorization status from them. If you previously were able to pass and are experiencing the problem just this time and/or if there are multiple people experiencing the same problem, possibly there is a malfunction with the smart card system. Firstly, you can inform your department authorization officer. If your authorization is still not defined, you can report the problem via  IT support page by using your user account information.

## Entry 2609

Question: How can I create web pages by using my METU user account?
Answer: 

Please remember to act in conformity with METU Information Technology Resources Use Policy when you are creating web pages. To view these ethical codes, you can visit this adress.
The following steps will guide you when creating web pages on METU central servers.

Enter your user code/password and connect your computer to central servers (orca, beluga, rorqual and narwhal) by using SSH programs like PuTTY or WinSCP.


wwwhome directory is automatically created in your web user account. To check the file permissions of wwwhome directory, run the following command:
 ls -ald wwwhome 
The following line will be displayed after this command is executed. The first 10 characters (drwxr-xr-x) on this line indicate the file permissions of wwwhome directory and each character specifying the permissions must be the same with the permissions in the line below. (If the characters are different, you should repeat the process explained in step 2 (above) beginning from the command "chmod og=rx wwwhome".)
 drwxr-xr-x 14 uid gid 1536 Sep 20 12:10 wwwhome

In the next step, enter the following command to check the file permissions of your home directory.
 ls -ald ~ 
Check to make sure that the first 10 characters of the line displayed are the same with the characters indicated below:
 drwx--x--x 14 uid gid 1536 Sep 20 12:10 user-code
If the characters specifiying the permissions are different, you should run the following command:
 chmod a+x ~
If the steps above are carried out accordingly, the necessary directory structure would be created that will enable you to create your web page.


Let us create a sample introduction page. Open the wwwhome directory by entering the following command.
 cd wwwhome

Then, create an index.html file by entering the sample command below; (You may use the editor you are most comfortable with like, pico, vi etc.)
 pico index.html 
and enter the sample information below into this file.
 < html > < title >Home Page< /title > < h3 >Welcome< /h3 > < /html > 

Save the information in the index.html and close the file. To view your first page, write the following URL address in your active web browser (Netscape, Internet Explorer etc.) The URL address you will be using on your active web browser will be like the following sample address:
users.metu.edu.tr/user_code (personal users)www.*****.metu.edu.tr/ (web users)

You have just created your introductory web page successfully. Please remember to keep the information you will be using on your web page in the wwwhome under the home directory. The following URLs address to people at various levels and may include information, which may help you if you are creating a web page or intending to use HTML code.
Sites in English:
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/ - Dave Raggett's Introduction to HTMLhttp://htmlhelp.org/ - HTML Help by The Web Design Group


And what's more, you can transfer the web pages you have created on your own computer via FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to your user account located on the systems and you can update the pages whenever you want in your account. It is important here not to forget specifying the file permissions of the files you will be transferring as "readable" by everyone. It will be easier for you to execute the following command and specify all the file permissions of the files accordingly in the end, i.e. after all your transfer operations are finished:
 chmod og=r file-name 

You can use various web editors while creating, updating and uploading your web pages.

## Entry 2617

Question: My user account is closed. How can I get my e-mail backups (if there are any) and open them?
Answer: 

User accounts of our students whose studentships are suspended or over for any reason are closed after one (1) school term. Our users whose user accounts will be closed are notified about it with an e-mail at particular times.
Alumni’s e-mail addresses in exxxxxxmetu.edu.tr format identified by METU Computer Center central servers can be directed to another e-mail address requested. Information related to forwarding service can be found in https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/how-can-i-use-metu-e-mail-forwarding address.
If you are not forwarded, since e-mails sent from other addresses won’t arrive after your user account is closed, there aren’t backups for sent e-mails after the closure date.
By logging into the e-mail account before the closure date, you can download your backups as a .mbox file to your computer as written on http://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/how-can-i-download-all-my-e-mails-horde
You can apply the methods below to see the e-mails sent to you via .mbox or tar.gz extended files and send it to another e-mail address of yours. As there is an extended tar.gz file that you downloaded to your computer, you can use 7-zip program to open it https://www.7-zip.org/ you don’t need such an opening program for .mbox file
In order to see the e-mails, you need to set up the Thunderbird program. You can follow the steps on https://www.thunderbird.net address for installation.
After you set up and open Thunderbird program, you must click Add-ons option from Settings part Add-ons section and set up ImportExportTools NG attachment on the pop-up window, by finding it from the search section. After the setup, Thunderbird client must be restarted. After it is restarted, create a new folder by right-clicking Local Folders at the left section and choosing New Folder. You can name it as you like.
In the sample below, we created a local folder named imported_mails.

Right-click the folder we have just created, from ImportExportTools NG menu: 
A) If you have a .mbox, by choosing Import mbox file, you can show your mbox extended file’s place and thus; reach your e-mails and direct it to another e-mail address, if you wish.

B) If you opened .tar.gz file with a zip program like 7-zip on a folder on your computer, you can continue with Import messages option. When you click Import messages option, first of all, you need to choose All files (*.*) as file type to display on the screen.
By choosing all files in related e-mail folders inside the taz.gz folder that you opened on the screen, you can make it visible on the Thunderbird client.
For example,>> Your e-mails that are in the Inbox are mails > INBOX > it’s inside of the cur folder. You may also access e-mail attachments seen on Thunderbird client from attachment section via this client and save on your computer.
