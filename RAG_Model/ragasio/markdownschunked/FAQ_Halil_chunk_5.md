To edit your address book in Roundcube, click the "Contacts" button in the main menu.

You can save the information you entered by clicking the "Save" button.
You can upload the existing address book to Roundcube with the help of the "Import" button. The "Import" button, which will appear when the add contacts window opens, allows address books (saved in vCard and CSV (comma-separated data) file formats) to be imported into Roundcube.
You can use the "Export" button to export the contacts in your address book in Roundcube. When you click this button, your contacts saved in Roundcube will be downloaded to your computer as a ".vcf" file.
Your address book and registered contacts that you previously created in Squirrelmail (sqrl.metu.edu.tr) will be copied to Roundcube after you log in to the Roundcube interface for the first time. However, after you log into the Roundcube interface for the first time, the address books in the Squirrelmail and Roundcube interfaces will continue to work independently.

## Entry 2702

Question: How can I delete my e-mails using Roundcube?
Answer: 

Using Roundcube, you can delete all messages in a mailbox or specific messages of your choosing.
When you click on the "Delete" button on the screen after selecting the e-mails you want to delete, these e-mails will be moved to the "Trash" folder.
You must also delete the e-mails from the "Trash" folder that you want to completely delete from your account. You can reach the "Trash" folder by clicking the "Trash" button in the "Mail" tab in the main menu. When you select the e-mails in the "Trash" folder that you want to delete completely and click the "Delete" button, these e-mails will be deleted directly without being moved to another folder.
You can have your e-mails sent to the "Trash" folder automatically deleted when you log out. To do this, click the "Server Settings" button in the "Settings" tab in the main menu, select the "Clear Trash on logout" option in the "Maintenance" section and save it. E-mails that you delete from your Inbox or other folders while you're signed in and that have been moved to Trash will be automatically deleted from Trash when you sign out.

## Entry 2703

Question: How can I filter incoming e-mails in Roundcube?
Answer: 

Roundcube's "Filters" feature can be used to prevent spam from taking up space in the "Inbox" folder or to automatically move e-mails from certain people and/or certain topics to certain folders.
To use this feature, after entering Roundcube, first click the "Settings" button on the main panel and then the "Filters" button.
Warning: The filters defined in the Horde, one of the METU webmail interfaces, can also be viewed and used from the Roundcube interface. New filters to be defined in Roundcube are added to the filter set previously defined in the Horde interface. On the other hand, filters created in Roundcube are deleted when filters are edited by logging into the Horde interface again after the filter is created in Roundcube. Although it is planned to eliminate this problem when the testing phase of the Roundcube interface is completed, we recommend our users to be careful about this issue.

Question: Bubble Sheet Assignments in Gradescope 
Answer: 

Bubble Sheet Assignments
Gradescope’s bubble sheet assignments allow you to create a multiple-choice answer key for the automatic grading of your students’ submissions. 
You need to use Gradescope’s 200-question bubble sheet template for student submissions. The provided PDF template includes the following fields:
Name - used for auto-matching uploaded submissions to students on your roster
ID - student ID, if applicable it can be used for auto-matching uploaded submissions to students on your roster
Section - enter a section name if applicable
Date - date the student completed the assignment
Version - used for the student to mark which version of the assignment they are assigned to
Other - a field to enter any other information you have requested from your students
Two hundred answer spaces - provided over two pages; only upload the used pages 
The template cannot be customized to contain question/answer content. You will need to provide students with a question list and multiple-choice answers outside of Gradescope.

To create a bubble sheet assignment:
Access your course dashboard and select Assignments from the left navigation menu.
Select the Create Assignment button from the taskbar at the bottom of the page. 
Select Bubble Sheet from the list of assignment types and then select Next at the bottom of the page.

Once you have your PDFs ready to upload, click Select PDF Files on the Manage Scans page.
Select your files and they will begin uploading. You can also drag and drop submissions directly onto the Manage Scans page. It's recommended that you upload PDFs that contain multiple student submissions for faster processing.
As soon as submissions are created on the Manage Scans page, Gradescope automatically attempts to match each submission to a student in the roster, using the Name and ID regions that you set up in the Edit Outline step. 
Answer Key
On the Answer Key page, allocate the correct answers to each numbered question for your assignment. You can create multiple versions of the same bubble sheet assignment, each having individual answer keys.

About Cisco Webex
Webex is an optimal solution for smartworking and distance learning.This document takes into account two main scenarios that are addressed by specific Webex applications for each scenario:
Distance lesson (virtual class)Focus on real-time collaboration between teacher and students with audio/video, application sharing, multimedia content, annotation and polls: Webex Meetings.In this scenario, students can join the lesson in guest mode, that is, without having to create a Webex account.
Collaboration between teachers and staff of the School InstituteAdvanced document chat and sharing capabilities in a more structured environment in addition to audio/video collaboration and screen sharing: Webex Teams.
Description of the setup process (preliminary)
TeacherThe teacher receives the welcome email -> click to set the password and install the Webex Meetings appStudentThe student installs Cisco Webex Meetings on their iPad/tablet/mobile device without having to create a Webex account
Setup for the teacher 
Click "activate" in the welcome emailThe browser opens, allowing the teacher to enforce their password
The Webex page loads in the browser
Click "Download" to download the Webex Meetings App and install it
Teacher login
Launch the Webex Meetings app on your PC and log in using your Webex credentials (email address and password)
Virtual lesson
The virtual lesson takes place in a virtual classroom represented by the so-called "Personal Room" or personal room of the teacher.This room represents the physical class of the school and the Personal Room provides digital tools that allow an advanced collaboration between teacher and students. Teachers can share their PC screen, show documents, applications, and even multimedia content.The Personal Room is run by the teacher. The teacher initiates the lesson by allowing the students to participate. The teacher can also mute or even expel one or more students and can record the lesson itself, to allow students who are absent to enjoy it later. The teacher can lock (equivalent to locking the classroom door) to prevent other students from connecting and finally, it is always the teacher who has the power to finish the lesson, closing the Personal Room.
How to use:
The professor organizes the video conference for the class using the link to WebexThe professor copies the Webex link of his/her Personal Room from the Webex appThe professor shares the link with the class through the most appropriate tool (electronic register, email etc)At the indicated time, the professor starts the meeting; students participate by clicking on the received linkStudents who connect in advance (before the professor starts the meeting) are waiting. They are equally waiting when the professor locks the meeting.
Lesson in progress (teacher side)
Clicking on "Start Meeting" (see slide above) starts the video preview to allow the teacher to verify that his video is ok. 
Clicking again on "Start Meeting" starts the actual lesson, with audio and video. As long as no student has connected Webex shows the white screen, with the teacher's video at the bottom of the page.
Student Participation
Premise: The student installed the Webex Meetings app and received, by email for example, the link to the lesson (link of the Personal Room)
Clicking on the link launches the Webex appThe student enters their first and last name and an email address -> click on "join meeting"(note: Webex account is not required, so no password is needed, and the email is purely informative)
The preview starts -> click "Join" to enter the virtual class
Note: With a non-standard browser, you may need to open the Webex Meetings app and insert the link to the lesson.
Lesson control (for the teacher)
The teacher can, through the list of participants, mute and possibly even expel the students individually. 
In addition, the teacher can turn off the camera during the lesson, share content, read what is written on chat screen, write a reply, survey (polling), share screen or application.
The teacher can, at any time, block access to the Personal Room by preventing additional participants (e.g. students of a different class) from entering. In the same way, the teacher can unlock it at any time. 
Only the teacher can finish the lesson. The teacher is also entitled to leave the Personal Room without the lecture ending, but in this case he will have to indicate another participant to take the lead on his/her behalf.
You can e-mail to odtuclass@metu.edu.tr for your questions and issues about Cisco Webex.

Question: How can I install Safe Exam Browser to the computers in my PC room? 
Answer: 

You can download the SEB for Windows Installation setup program (also containing the SEB Windows configuration tool) from SEB website. After download is completed, start SafeExamBrowserInstaller.exe and follow the steps in the installation program. The installation is straighforward.
After the installation, you need to configure the software with SEBConfigTool.exe located in the SEB application folder (usually C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86)).
In most cases, you need to set only the settings in the General pane (like the URL which SEB opens and the passwords to open a config file for editing and to quit/restart SEB) and leave the default values for all other settings which present "secure" options. You also need to enable Safe Exam Browser setting from ODTÜClass. https://safeexambrowser.org/windows/win_usermanual_en.html#LMS
Once you have a config file for your browser, you can share it to all of your examinees, either by a .SEB file or by online (publish the config file from your website). They can complete the settings on their own computers with this link.

## Entry 2713

Question: Where can I find information about ReCaptcha image validation (I'm not a robot) on the registration page?
Answer: 

Google ReCaptcha service is added to the user's browser automatically and verified by Google. In addition, since this service has a timeout, the verification may time out by itself when the correct ones are selected from the images shown on the screen and waiting for a while.
In addition to these, accesses from different IP addresses, some extension used in the browser, opening many pages in the incognito tab, wrong selections in the images provided by the ReCaptcha service may cause more information to be requested and verification images to be shown in order to prove that you are not a robot in subsequent verifications.
You can experience how the Google ReCaptcha service works outside the registration page by accessing https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo?invisible=false and experience the image verification service that will appear on the screen by opening the same address in an incognito tab.
In some cases, there are inconsistencies between the information requested by the ReCaptcha verification service and the images displayed on the screen. For example, when the service requests you to select a fire hydrant in verification, there may not be a fire hydrant in the pictures shown. In such a case, it is necessary to proceed to the next verification by clicking skip. We do not interfere with the Google ReCaptcha verification service used on our registration page.

Question: Can I Install Applications in PC Rooms?
Answer: 

PC Rooms which are operated by Computer Center, serve the entire university, and the software purchased with the campus license agreement is installed on the computers. Licensed software at https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/what-list-software-available-pc-rooms can be used in PC rooms.
Users who log in to computers in PC rooms have a restricted user profile and cannot install programs. Some programs that do not require administrator permission can run on these PCs if there is a portable feature.
Application installation requested by restricted users in public computer labs is not possible due to security, license and compatibility reasons. This type of application installation involves the following risks:
Security Risk: PC rooms are environments that many different users can access and need to be secure. If any user changes an application in the computer lab or installs malware, all of our users may be affected. This can compromise the integrity and security of PC rooms.License and Legal Responsibilities: An application can be installed in a public computer room if it is purchased with a campus license agreement. Failure of applications to meet these requirements may result in license violation and therefore legal problems.Data Loss Risk: There is a risk of data loss during application installation. The security and integrity of the data inside the computers used in the PC rooms is always a priority.Compatibility Issues: The installed application may be incompatible with other applications inside the PC, which may affect the efficiency of the computers.

## Entry 2765

Question: What can I do to make my Apple MAC computer more secure?
Answer: 

APPLE MAC SECURITY PRECAUTIONS
Your Apple MAC computer can get the threats from two sources:
1. The Internet 2. Direct Access / Physical Access (if you leave your computer unattended or without taking the necessary precautions)
What can you do to increase your MAC’s security features?
Basically, you will do all the configuration by clicking the Apple icon on the left top corner and choosing the System Preferences option.

1. Using a standard user: When setting up a new operating system, the user that is defined is an administrator type user. Admin users are entitled to make any changes on the computer. It’s a safer practice to use your computer with standard user rather than an administrative user. (Apple>System Preferences> User and Groups option you can change the user type to standard and renew the password.)

2. Secure Password Policy:
Do not choose your password from easily guessable passwords like your name, birthday, phone number or from ones that can be obtained from dictionary or brute force attacks. Secure password policy can be summarized in its simplest form as: A phrase containing at least 8 characters including uppercase, lower case letters, special characters (!, #, $, +, &) and digits. 
3. Disable Automatic login Option:
Disable automatic login option (login without entering a password to the computer).  (Apple > System Preferences > User and Groups >  Login Options; choose automatic login off).

4. Uninstall Flash Player
Flash Player is a software that can contain many security vulnerabilities. If you do not use the software at all, just uninstall it. If you do use it, then set it to make updates automatically. (Apple > System Preferences)

5. Use a Password Manager:
In the world of today, we use many different passwords for various purposes and of course we have to remember them. We would again like to remind you about the password policy in number 2. Besides, instead of keeping all the passwords in your memory, you can keep only one password in mind which is the password manager program’s password and keep the all the other passwords in the manager program safely. (Programs like Key Chain, 1 Password, Keeper that you can download from App Store)
6. Encrypt the files in your disk with File Vault:
If there are valuable files on your MAC computer, you can encrypt your files towards unwanted access. (Apple > System Preferences > Security&Privacy > FileVault tab and turn it on.)

7. Review your Spotlight Permissions:
Spotlight forwards your searches to Apple and Apple can share your information to third party partners. If you would like your search information to remain private, review your Spotlight options. (Apple > System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy tab, you can define exceptions for your information not be forwarded.

8. Location Services
Inspect your applications that you share your location services with, and disable the ones that are unnecessary. (Apple > System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy tab) Do not forget that the “Find My MAC” application works with location services; and if your MAC is lost or stolen you will be able find your device with the help of this feature. It’s a better idea to use location services with appropriate permissions. 

9. Software Updates
Follow the software updates frequently, and even set it to an automatic version. (Apple > System Preferences > App Store tab there is an option to automatically download and set up the updates).

10. Use Your Screen Saver Efficiently
Do not leave your computer unattended. For securing the computer and the data on it, define a screensaver that will activate after a short time the computer stays idle and will be disabled only by entering your password. (Apple > System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver).
11. Activate your Firewall
Activate your firewall and enable it in stateful mode, which means, no one will be able to make a connection to your computer unless you start the connection. (Apple > System Preferences > Security&Privacy > Firewall tab; activate with Firewall on; click Firewall options > Block all incoming connections option will enable your firewall to become a stateful firewall.)


12. Sharing
Control your Sharing. Avoid unnecessary sharing and disable them. (Apple > System Preferences > Sharing) Use this tab to control each service and disable the ones that are unnecessarily enabled. 

13. Define a Firmware Password:
You are encrypting the data on your computer with FileVault but this still does not guarantee a malicious person to boot your computer with a USB stick and erase all the data or install operating system from scratch, in case your computer is stolen or lost. When you define a firmware password, unlike in the case of PCs, firmware password will be asked only if you try to boot the system with unconventional ways. To define firmware password: When booting up the computer, press Cmd+R when the Apple logo appears; then on the screen that appears select Utilitiesà Firmware Password Utility. Please be careful defining this password, since if you forget it, you may need to visit the Apple Authorized Service.
14. Two Step Authentication
If you define two step authentication on your MAC, you will add an additional layer of security. (The second step is a verification code that comes to your telephone) You can find information on Apple’s web page about two step authentication.
15. Guest User
Defining a guest user: If you have enabled FileVault, you can use guest user and login the computer without password; use just Safari and all the data generated through the guest login is erased after the user logs out. Enabling the guest user on the computer enables the computer to be relocated after it’s lost or stolen. (Apple > System Preferences > User & Groups option).

16. Find My MAC!
Activate Find My MAC to relocate your computer if it is stolen or lost. (Apple > System Preferences > iCloud > Find My MAC must be selected.)
17. Third Party Antivirus Software
You can use third party antivirus software to determine malicious code on your MAC. For example, you can use the free version of BitDefender (Can we downloaded from App Store).
18. Use VPN
If you utilize open wireless networks a lot (like airports, coffee shops, libraries etc) you can take advantage of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to secure your traffic over the Internet. (Apple > System Preferences > Network, in the box on the left side, click “+” to set up VPN service.) METU offers a VPN service to the users but through this service you can access only local services and network of METU. Visit page https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/how-can-i-use-metu-vpn-service-mac-os-x-installed-devices to setup VPN service of METU.

19. Use Legal Software
Do not install illegal software. Do not use Warez. If you use software from Warez, you enable unwanted, malicious codes on your computer. To increase your security, install software only from App Store or identified developers. (Apple > System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General tab, choose Allow apps downloaded in a secure way).
20. Backup Your Data
You should always backup your valuable data against theft, loss, physical damage on disc etc. (Apple > System Preferences > Time Machine).

21. use eduroam SSID for wireless in METU
There are 2 SSIDs for wireless network in METU Campus, eduroam and ng2k. ng2k is an open wireless network that works with MAC address authentication. On the other hand eduroam is secure wireless network working on RADIUS based 8021.x security standard. Furthermore if you setup eduroam on your device, you can wireless network in any institution that is a member of the eduroam infrastructure. You can visit http://eduroam.metu.edu.tr to get information about setting up eduroam SSID on your computer.
