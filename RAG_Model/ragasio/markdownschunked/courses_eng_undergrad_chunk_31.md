ENG102: This course belongs to SCHOOL OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES. COURSE DESCRIPTION
With a particular emphasis on academic research and speaking, English for Academic Purposes II recycles and builds on the skills of academic writing, critical analysis and organization that were introduced in the pre-requisite course English for Academic Purposes I. The course introduces the key concepts of reliable academic research and information literacy, exposes students to authentic academic materials in written, oral and visual formats, and thereby has the ultimate aim of helping learners become more autonomous and resourceful in their academic studies. Classwork of ENG 102 involves close reading and analysis of the source texts, followed by class discussions, which requires deep understanding and evaluation of and reaction to the materials. Students are also expected to use library resources and online databases to find reliable sources, critically evaluate these materials to formulate their own arguments and produce intellectually mature and thorough essays and oral performances. Compared to ENG 101, in ENG 102, students will have more opportunities for speaking tasks such as debates and discussions that require higher order thinking skills, which will not only prepare them for the sequel course, ENG 211 Academic Speaking Skills, but also for their later studies. 
 
WRITING
Students will: 1. conduct research and find relevant sources to use by evaluating sources critically and effectively; develop wellreasoned and relevant ideas that are supported with reliable evidence 2. analyze writing prompts and produce relevant responses that address a given prompt fully 3. write coherent, logical, organized, and well-developed academic essays by following stages of process writing 4. incorporate citations accurately and effectively in writing by identifying relevant information from different texts and synthesizing them, by paraphrasing, summarizing and quoting directly from outside sources, and by giving correct references in APA style
SPEAKING
Students will practise communicating effectively in academic contexts by: 1. participating in discussions 2. expressing and justifying their opinions in whole class/group discussions/debates 3. reacting to different ideas to agree / disagree / refute / justify 4. analyzing and synthesizing information from different sources to justify their opinions 5. giving short individual or group presentations
READING Students will practise reading a text: 1. strategically to identify relevant sources for their purpose and eliminate the irrelevant ones: predict content by looking at title and subtitles, reading the abstract, introduction & conclusion, skimming and scanning the text 2. to comprehend it fully (identifying main/supporting ideas, identifying tone, purpose, and audience, recognizing patterns of organization and cohesive devices, text annotation, guessing meaning from context) 3. critically by identifying inferred meanings, arguments, and attitude, distinguishing between facts and opinions, and evaluating information to make critical judgments 4. to use it as support in writing by evaluating and synthesizing information from multiple texts 
LISTENING
Students will practise: 1. listening for a specific purpose 2. listening for main ideas and supporting ideas/details 3. listening for implied ideas 4. listening and note-taking 5. recognizing the relationship between a recording/video and a reading text 6. reflecting on and reacting to ideas in a recording/video 7. evaluating ideas in a recording/video to use them as support in their own writing 
 
 
The course reinforces academic writing skills. In this course students write different types of essays based on the ideas they are exposed to in the reading selections. The emphasis is on the writing process in which students go through many stages from brainstorming and outlining to producing a complete documented piece of writing.

Literary texts is a learner-centred course that will be offered at a technical university. Therefore, specific needs and background of technical university students as well as those studying social sciences are taken into consideration during the design process.  The course aims to provide students with practice in four skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening). The course also appeals to students who are interested in literature, since it offers literary materials either as reading texts or as writing prompts to which students can respond to either in the form of an essay or an extended research on the assigned theme of the week. At production level, higher-order thinking skills such as synthesizing and evaluating information as well as producing ideas and forming judgements will be required. In this course, a thematic approach will be adopted, and course materials will be chosen among literary texts that revolve around certain thematic concerns such as war, migration, city, nature, house and body.  Each theme will be discussed for two weeks. At the end of two weeks, students will be assigned paragraphs, presentations, group presentations on the theme of the week.
