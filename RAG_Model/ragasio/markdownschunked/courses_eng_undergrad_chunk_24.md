## Entry 1868

CENG280: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER ENGINEERING. Computer Science needs mathematical languages to abstract away from particulars of computing machinery and to concentrate on systematicity, capacity, and efficiency of computing in the abstract. Theory of formal languages studies such languages while automata theory studies their acceptors. Both theories have found scientific and practical use in all areas of computer science and engineering. In fact, description of any computational process can be recast in formal language theory or automata theory. From this perspective, the theory can be seen as a vehicle for communicating the ideas clearly and precisely among computer scientists.
This course is an introduction to the topic.
 
Introduction to strings, languages and grammars. Concept of abstract machines and language acceptance. Deterministic and non-deterministic finite state machines. Regular expressions. Machines with pushdown tape. Turing Machines and recursive functions.

PHIL215: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. No objective 
Many of the philosophical schools of antiquity saw philosophy as the ´art of living´ rather than merely teaching abstract theory or the exegesis of texts. Philosophical practice is an attempt by philosophers to return philosophy to its ancient and practical roots. The course, therefore, is an inquiry into the role of philosophy in our daily life. For this purpose ideas of of great philosophers from Pythagoras to Postmodenism are discussed and moral, aesthetic and political implications of their views of philosophy and practice are studied and criticized.

## Entry 1917

PHIL235: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Logic is the study of "good" reasoning. We all have some basic intuitions about what counts as "good" or "acceptable" reasoning, but those intuitions fail most of the time, especially in cases where reasoning is more complex. Logic is the discipline that formalizes those intuitions so that the failure of distinguishing "good" reasoning from "bad" reasoning is minimized. In this course, we will study one of the two main types of logic, i.e. deductive logic (the other being inductive logic). The topics  that will be covered are validity, soundness, truth-table methods, natural deduction proof techniques and some metatheorems. The course will be useful for any student who aims to improve his/her analytical thinking skills.
 
Logic as a formal science; inference, implication, validity and truth; syllogism.

PHIL351: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. At the end of this course, students will have gained knowledge of classical ethical theories and will be able to apply them to contemporary moral problems.
 
The course will begin with consideration of various arguments encountered in everyday life of ethical or moral issues: Is the death penalty a morally acceptable type of punishment? Is the censorship of pornography ethically justified? What are our moral obligations with respect to the environment and what is the appropriate moral foundation for those obligations?. After developing some skill in identifying ethical and moral arguments and disagreement on such issues, major ethical theories such as utilitarianism, Kantianism,    egoism, etc., will be applied to these moral problems. In order to fulfill this aim, several concrete and pressing moral problems will be chosen. The student will be encouraged to write and think clearly about these problems, weighing alternative solutions and criticising those which are weak and untenable. The main focus will be to give the student the skill necessary to identify a moral problem and to introduce her to critical thinking over moral issues.

PHIL352: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. When studying a philosophical position, it may be very hard, and even inappropriate to make a distinction between the content of the philosophical position and its form or better the activity itself. However, it can be done so for a pedagogical reason: to learn about the tool-box of philosophical constructions. Moreover, it is a good philosophical practice –yes there is a hidden agenda- because all this boils down to a simple question: what does it mean to engage philosophical practice?

PHIL395: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Course Description: The Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection is one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the modern era. Although it is a theory of biology with its revolutionary consequences in all life sciences it has also had an enormous impact on science in general, philosophy, religion, and politics the last 150 years. This course traces the teleological notions of design and purpose from the Greek antiquity and medieval Europe through 17th century to early 19th century to prepare the intellectual background for the Darwinian theory of evolution and then investigates the Darwinian response to this background. 
COURSE OBJECTIVES: The aim of this course is to demonstrate students how evolutionary theory naturalized teleological notions, such as purpose and design, by tracing these teleological notions from the Greek antiquity and medieval Europe through 17th century to 19th centuries.

Important note:  If you are not a philosophy major, you may be allowed to take this course but only if you have taken at least several philosophy (or humanties / social sciences) courses before.  Consult with me if you intend to take the course so that I can assess if your background is adequate.
This course is about pragmatism which emerged as a philosophical school in the USA about a century ago and is currently regarded as one of the most influential philosophical perspectives or approaches now.  We will take a look at the original defenders of this movement and then consider some of its more recent proponents.  Our aim is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of pragmatism vis-a-vis its ontological and epistemological aspects and also with regard to its social-political implications.  We will also try to evaluate pragmatism from a broader philosophical perspective, asking the question of how pragmatism views philosophy as an intellectual discipline.  To that end we will focus on Richard Rorty's ideas on truth and the identity of philosophy.  We will discuss Rorty's reading of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and evaluate his controversial construal of Orwell and related ideas.
 
A study of American Pragmatism and its influence on contemporary cultural/intellectual life. Study of the founders of the pragmatist movement such as Charles S. Peirce, William James and John Dewey, the pragmatist critigue of the epistemological and ontological traditions, pragmatism s reaction to intellectual tendencies in philosophy, possible precursors of pragmatists in the 19th century (such as F. Nietzsche), pragmatists views on knowledge, scientific endeavor, morality, social progress, education, and democracy, more recent representatives of pragmatism such as Richard Rorty, the connection between pragmatism and liberalism and totalitarianism, traditional and contemporary reactions to pragmatism, the controversy about pragmatism s position in the philosophical debate between realism and anti-realism.
