IR224: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. The course instructs on the philosophy of science and philosophy of language, two distinct areas of philosophy arguably at the heart of the concept of academic learning. The instruction aims to facilitate an exploration of the question of method for social and political research in the wider setting of human sciences. The so-called second great debate within the discipline of International Relations, roughly between traditionalism and behavioralism, is arguably still key to the assessments of method in the study area. The course seeks to inform students on this debate in the context of the overall question of method in social and political research towards generating knowledge. Students are expected to gain skills and competencies in relation to a basic set of issues in research.

What is knowledge?
What is fact?
How is knowledge claimed to be generated in academic research?
What exactly is research?
What are the possibly inherent limitations in digging for data?
In what specific ways do researchers suggest possible distinctions between fact and value?
What to make of concepts such as theory, interpretation, objectivity and subjectivity in the acquisition and use of social and political data?

 
The aim of the course is to provide students with a basic knowledge of research methods in the social sciences, with special emphasis on research methods in International Relations. The course has the twofold aim of acquainting students with epistemological issues in the conduct of research in the social  sciences, while also providing students with practical research skills ,including research design, data collection and analysis, and use  of library resources.

Global order has changed with the end of the Cold War. The old defining struggle between a capitalist West and a communist East has passed. Since then, some key policy discussions led by the North have linked national and international security to questions about potential future dangers of social and political disruptions resulting from environment degradation and economic underdevelopment in the South. Once again the world is divided into the North and the South, with the North making decisions to maintain global political and economic status quo –inadequate distribution of natural resources and wealth-  and safeguarding security, and the South being managed without its consent. This course aims to provide the students with a comprehensive understanding of the North-South relations from the perspective of environment, development and security.

IR328: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. Is war (the use of force in international politics) reducible to a science with immutable facts and logics? If so, what is the utility of strategy and how does it relate to international relations? How does any of this help decisionmakers obtain security? For that matter, what even is security and how does it contrast with peace? If you have ever had any questions like these, Security and Strategy will be a great starting point. The goal of this course is to familiarize students with concepts like strategy and security, introduce them to the International Security subfield of IR, and discuss specialized topics that lie at the intersection of IR Theory, Security, and Anthropology. By the conclusion of this course, students can expect to develop a precise understanding of the concept of strategy with its numerous nuances, the role of force in world politics, and deliberate on the precise origins and meanings of concepts like war and peace. The students will also receive an introduction into basic debates in Security Studies as they learn about traditional topics such as war and nuclear deterrence, as well as more recent discussions about political violence, non-state actors, and the illicit global economy.
 
This course examines the range of security threats that the international community faces at the beginning of the new millennium and discusses, both at the level of discourse and the level of practice, how the international community is responding to the persistence of such threats as nuclear proliferation and terrorism and the emergence of new ones such as chemical and biological warfare, pandemics and mass migration. Special emphasis will be placed on comparing and contrasting traditional security paradigm with newly emerging ones, as well as their complex interaction.

The domestic political framework of Turkish foreign policy.
Evolution of Turkey's political system.
The impact of political actors, institutions, and ideologies in the domestic and foreign policy of Turkey.
 
Foreign policy has conventionally been understood as detached from the domestic policy environment. This is derived from the realist assumption that there exists a clear demarcation line between the domestic and the international. Yet this assumption has been questioned by theoretical analysis as well as practical developments in recent years. This course aims at elaborating domestic sources of foreign policy making in the context of Turkish politics. It is based on the hypothesis that an `interactional` approach better serves to the understanding of both Turkish domestic politics and Turkish foreign policy. Thus the course will explain domestic sources of foreign policy issues, like democratization, human rights, the Kurdish question, the role of the military in Turkish politics etc.

In recent years, controversial issues such as deepening, differentiation and enlargement, politicization of European integration and the latest crises have tested the EU to its limits and increasingly divided political elites and mass publics. Starting with a solid overview of the post-Maastricht European integration process in transformation, this course will analyse the key issues and debates related to the political system of the EU and to the politics of European integration. While most mainstream courses on the EU describe the history, the institutions, policy areas and theorizing about European integration, this course aims at familiarising the students with the key controversies that have shaped the Union and the recent crises that are now openly reshaping the EU policy process(es), polity and politics, both empirically and theoretically. Therefore, a basic knowledge of and familiarity with the process of European integration and the EU institutional system is required.
