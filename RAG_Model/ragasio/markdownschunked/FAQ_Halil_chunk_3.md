## Entry 2630

Question: How can I find out about the final status of the disk space and my quota I have used up?
Answer: 

The disk space allocated for user account owners on the central servers is designated as quota. Two different quota areas are allocated for METU users and their capacities are independent from each other. While it is possible to find about the latest state of both quotas with the Horde service, it is only possible to find out about the latest status of the file quota with terminal software like SSH and others. 
Displaying quota information with Horde Service: 
First, you must enter the Horde system by https://horde.metu.edu.tr address, then you must select the File Manager option under the left menu bar's "My Account" title. You can see both the file quota and the e-mail quota information by pressing the Check Quota button.
Due to E-mail Quota applications, when quota limits are exceded, incoming e-mails can not be delivered to the receiver and will be returned to the sender. So that, it is important to use e-mail quotas within the limits.
Displaying file quota information with Shell Client Programs (SSH etc.): 
Connect to your user account by using a terminal program like SSH and write the command 
 
quota
on the command line. Click Enter to view the status of your file quota. The following screen will be displayed: 

On this screen, you will see the following terms; 
blocks indicates the space you take up on your file quota in kilobytes, quota indicates the limit of your file quota in kilobytes, limit indicates the maximum amount that your file quota could get hold of in kilobytes, grace indicates the time that has remained from your grace period, files indicates the number of files available on your file quota.

## Entry 2631

Question: I am over quota, what should I do?
Answer: 

The disk space allocated for user account owners on the central servers is designated as quota. Two different quota areas are allocated for METU users, one for their files and one for their e-mail. The procedures to be followed are different when file or e-mail message quotas are full.
For the e-mail messages quota:
Another quota is designated for the disk area where the user keeps the e-mail messages. When 90% of this quota is full, an alert message is sent to the user.
Due to E-mail Quota applications, when quota limits are exceded, incoming e-mails can not be delivered to the receiver and will be returned to the sender. So that, it is important to use e-mail quotas within the limits.
When the e-mail messages quota is exceeded or near the upper limit, measures such as;
deleting unnecessary and bulky e-mail messages,
keeping the e-mail message attachments on the hard disk of the computer being used
may be taken and the overload on the quota can be reduced.
For the file quota:
"quota exceeded" message tells you that, at present, you are using all of the disc space that is granted to you for the files on the server systems. Currently, the procedure allows a file quota of 100 MB to students and 250 MB to the personnel.
You can display your disk usage and file quota with command quota
If you draw near to your limit value, you may not be able to access to your account. Remember that Blocks value should not be higher than the Limit value. Otherwise you will receive "quota exceed" message.
When you exceed the quota limits, the first thing you have to do is to find out the files with the largest sizes. You should either zip them or delete the unnecessary ones. Enter the following commands,
to see the spaces used by each of your file;
ls -l
ls -l |more
to zip your files;
 gzip

to open the files that you have zipped;gunzip
To change the directory you are in, enter this command;cd <directory_name>
to delete file(s) you can refer to this page

## Entry 2632

Question: What is the size of a user account quota?
Answer: 

The disk space allocated for user account owners on the central servers is designated as quota. Two different quota areas are allocated for METU users and their capacities are independent from each other.
Depending on their status, METU users have the below indicated e-mail quota on the servers:
Students:  250 MB
METU Administrative Staff and Research Assistants:  750 MB
 METU Academic Staff :  1.5 GB
When 90% of this quota is full, an alert message is sent to the user.
Due to E-mail Quota applications, when quota limits are exceded, incoming e-mails can not be delivered to the receiver and will be returned to the sender. So that, it is important to use e-mail quotas within the limits.
Depending on their status, METU users have the below indicated file quota on the servers:
Students:  100 MB
METU Staff: 250 MB
Units within the EİS Project:  250 MB
Student Groups: 250 MB
Web users: 250 MB
In compulsory cases you can apply for a file or e-mail quota increase by opening a support ticket via https://itsupport.metu.edu.tr and state the type of quota you want to increase and the reason for the increase request.

Not enough ANSYS HPC licenses
The Ansys HPC (related to core usage in analysis) campus license includes a common HPC pool. Therefore, users on the campus using Ansys CFD, Mechanical, and Electronics software use the same common HPC repository. As there may be more Ansys CFD and Mechanical users in the campus license, they may have used cores from the common HPC repository. Thus, users using Ansys Electronics software may have fewer cores left, as the number of cores in the common HPC pool will vary according to the use of other users. Therefore, the number of HPC core usage, which varies in the number of users using HPC cores, maybe due to this reason.

Question: How to install the software using ISO (CD/DVD images) files?
Answer: 

You can download the licensed installation files on https://software.cc.metu.edu.tr within the campus borders. Some files can be accessed as CD/DVD images (ISO files) because of the technical requirements and ease of use.These image files can be written into CD/DVD (using software such as Nero, Imgburn (free)) and they can be used directly through CD/DVD.
Suggested Practical Way: 7-zip
The suggested and practical way is to download and install 1 MB sized 7-zip software from https://www.7-zip.org/ and extract the content by right clicking the downloaded ISO file. The software can be installed by running setup.exe in the newly created folder.
DAEMON TOOLS:
Daemon Tools is a software that is used to run the CD/DVD images of different folder systems (such as ISO, NRG, CUE) as virtual CD/DVD in Windows Operating Systems. In this way, it is no longer a must to write ISO files into CD/DVD or to keep the file in the same way it is extracted. This way is recommended to users who use ISO files frequently.
It is recommended to download latest version from https://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite/.
Installation: Firstly, the installation file (e.g. daemon410.exe) is saved to the local machine and run. The installation may need to restart.
Configuration and Usage: after installation, you can see the icon in the notification area, right of the toolbar.. By right clicking you can specify the number of devices you can use and mount images (CD/DVDs).

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR VULNERABILITY
Recently discovered that a potential security vulnerability is found in Mathematica 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3 on Linux operating systems. Under certain circumstances, users of your system could execute arbitrary Wolfram Language code as root. Recent versions of Wolfram systems containing VernierLink were shipped with a vulnerability potentially allowing non-root users to run arbitrary commands as root. This only affects machines where the Wolfram System was installed as root. We therefore strongly recommend you apply the following steps to all Linux systems on which any of these Wolfram System versions are installed.
Resolution:
If you do not use or plan to use the VernierLink functionality in Mathematica, remove the vulnerable file:

sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/wolfram-vernierlink-libusb.rules 
You may be prompted to provide admin-level credentials to complete this action.
If you are connecting Mathematica to Vernier-branded external devices using VernierLink, adjust the permissions of this file:

sudo chmod 644 /etc/udev/rules.d/wolfram-vernierlink-libusb.rules 
You may be prompted to provide admin-level credentials to complete this action.

Error Code


Description


Suggested Solution


102x3


No license with the entered license name has been found in the MAXQDA Netlic Service.


Please check the license name for typing errors.
It should be “METUMAXQDA”.


102x7


The client is currently using the license in another instance of MAXQDA. A license can only be used in one MAXQDA instance on the same device.


Use the previously opened instance of MAXQDA or close it to use the license in the new instance of MAXQDA.
Restart the application.


102x8


The requested license is not activated or invalid.


Check whether the requested license has not been activated or has expired. If necessary, remove the license from the MAXQDA Netlic Service.


102x9


The requested license does not match this version of MAXQDA.


Please check which license has been configured to be used with this version of MAXQDA.
It should be MAXQDA 2022.


102x10


The client device is not on the whitelist or cannot be added automatically and therefore does not have permission to use the license.


Check whether the name that was entered is correct.


102x11


The client device is listed on the blacklist and is therefore excluded from the use of the license.


Use VPN for out-of-campus entries.


102x12


The maximum number of simultaneously connected clients has been reached for the requested license.


A new space will be available once a currently connected client stops working with MAXQDA.


104x15


A connection to the MAXQDA Netlic Service could not be established or was disconnected.


Please check your network connection and the specified server address as well as the port.
