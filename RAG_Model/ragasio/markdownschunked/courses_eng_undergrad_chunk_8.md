PHYS400: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS. In PHYS 400 you are given the opportunity to study a problem important in Physics and important to the instructor which you have chosen to work with.  Your instructor is your mentor, and he/she will guide you in reporting on the problem effectively. Upon completion of this course you will experience what it means to do research in Physics, write a concise scientific report/paper, and present your work to a committee of physicists. Not all problems and work done towards investigating that problem is equal. However, all are important. And what is most important is that you enjoy the subject matter of the problem you are working on. This course does not expect you to solve a new problem and it does not expect for you to become an expert on that problem, what is expected of you is that you understand the problem and are able to explain it to others both in your presentation and report/paper. Some students end up publishing their investigation in a scientific journal, while others continue to work with their instructor at the completion of this course towards this goal. And some others use the experience gained in this course to look for jobs.  PHYS 400 is the first and only time you are given a chance to work independently in Physics. You are given a rare opportunity to show your skill and commitment as a young physicist.

PHIL110: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. No objective 
This course aims to introduce students to the most important concepts and problems of the main branches of philosophy from a systematical-rather than a historical- point of view. It starts with the question of what philosophy is. The answer to this question lies in finding a criterion by means of which philosophy can be differentiated from science and various other human activities. The rest of the course discusses the following basic topics. Validity of arguments (logic), the nature of truth and knowledge (epistemology), the fundamental categories of being (ontology), the meaning of linguistic expressions (philosophy of language), scientific concepts and theories (philosophy of science), the distinction between morally good and bad (ethics), and, finally beauty in nature and value of artworks (aesthetics).

PHIL201: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. This course offers an introductory survey to various ethical theories within the history of western philosophy, including virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, social contract theory, feminist ethics, and existentialist ethics. Bringing these ethical frameworks to bear on contemporary ethical issues, this course seeks to combine theoretical and applied approaches to ethics. Beginning with the question of “the good life,” we shall ask: Why live ethically? And how to live ethically? Tracing how each philosopher with whom we engage responds to these questions, the students are expected to develop an understanding of different kinds of ethical reasoning, which in turn would enable them to analyze issues and propose an informed, intelligent response. As their final project, the students will write a paper in which they take up a specific ethical problem (e.g. capital punishment, suicide, prostitution, torture, hunger strike, pornography, etc.) and argue for a position by utilizing and building on the kinds of ethical reasoning we traced and scrutinized throughout the semester.
 
Problems of moral conduct. Theories of ethics.

PHIL204: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. A note about who can take the course:  This PHIL undergraduate course is open to Philosophy students only.  I am unable to admit non-Philosophy students during normal registration week.  If, however, some people drop the course in the following week, I may admit a few more students to the course.  If you want to be considered during the add-drop period, send me an e-mail before it explaining your background.
COURSE DESCRIPTION:
     "ΓΝΩΘΙ ΣΕΑΥΤΟΝ"
     (Inscription at Apollo’s Temple at Delphi)
This course is intended to be the second part of a general introduction to theory of knowledge. Although I will assume in my lectures a basic philosophical background and some familiarity with epistemological notions (as provided, for instance, by PHIL-106), the course can in principle be taken independently --i.e., without previously taking PHIL-106.
In this course, we will cover some historical material as well as readings from contemporary epistemology literature.  The course will have three main philosophical/discursive axes: (1) Epistemology of Perception, (2) Theories of Justification, and finally (3) Feminist Epistemology.  In dealing with (2) above, emphasis will be placed especially on the debate between foundationalism and coherentism.  And we will study part (3) as an example of the contemporary reaction to traditional analytic epistemology.
Grading:  Students will write two in-class examinations: (1) The mid-term exam will probably take place in April (40% grade value); (2) The remaining part of your total grade will come from the final exam (60% grade value).  Please note that if you take only one of those two exams, you will get an ‘F’ grade.
 
Common-sense knowledge and scientific knowledge. The growth of knowledge; rationality and progress.

PHIL208: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. At the end of this course, students will have learned,
some challenges to human morality (amoralism, theism, relativism) and how to deal with them,
the basic concepts of metaethic (realism, subjectivism, intrinsic value),
the fundamental theories of normative ethics (consequentialism, virtue ethics, deontological/Kantian ethics),
the basic concepts of and problems in environmental ethics (speciesism, rights of animals, anthropocentrism, biocentrism, ecocentrism)
 
Environmental ethics is a crucial as well as a controversial area of applied ethics that approaches normative issues and principles related with human intervention with the natural environment. It is crucial for the guidance of individuals, corporations, and governments in determining the principles affecting their policies, lifestyles, and actions across the entire range of environmental issues. It is controversial for the complexity of environment, conflict of interest in environment, and human centered ethical traditions, concepts and theories neglecting non-human environment. So while uncertainty and conflict of interest increase the demands on ethical principles, the basic assumptions of traditional ethics are difficult to extend to the non-human environment. Environmental ethics must also be a theoretical field of ethics to deal, for example, with the following problems. People have rights, but do other (higher) animals? Do plants even have interests? Can only individuals deserve to be subject for moral considerations or can group of individuals, such as species and ecosystem also? These and similar questions are treated by both anthropocentrists and ecocentrists.

PHIL211: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. No objective 
This course is an inquiry into the role of emotion in a rational life. As an introductory course, it requires no pre-knowledge of philosophy. It tries to explore the role that emotion plays in the acquisition of  beliefs and desires, the relation between them, and their transformation into actions and policies. It studies also emotions considered as a component of life and experience and investigate whether they may themselves be subject to rational assessment. For this purpose it goes to the historical roots of the problem of emotions, e.g. what role does it play in our life? What is an emotion? These questions are important in the philosophy of mind and ethics. Philosophers have not always despised the importance of emotions. Hume, for example, claimed that reason is and ought to be, the slave of passion. Nietzsche, on the other hand, insisted that emotion and reason are not really opposite but complementary to each other. In this course, the claims of important philosophers are discussed and moral, aesthetic political implications of their view of emotion are criticized.

PHIL212: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. No objective 
This course is an introduction to the philosophy of literature. The fundamental question discussed in this course is how philosophy, ordinary life and literature are related. How can we draw boundary line between philosophy and literature? How are literary works structured? With these questions the course addresses the philosophical question about the role of art in human life. The continuity of everyday life and the coherence of artistic literature are distinct though closely related. In ancient Greece, Literature was crucial for philosophy´ s own self definition. Subsequent philosophy of literature has been denoted to overcoming Plato´s condemnatory theory. The vast majorities of theories follow Plato in treating literature as a distinct domain, separate from and subordinate to philosophy. But since Romanticism, some have argued for the essential unity of these two enterprises. The course studies the relation between life, literature and philosophy within historical context as well as in contemporary culture.

PHIL214: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. COURSE DESCRIPTION: The Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection is one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the modern era. Although it is a theory of biology with its revolutionary consequences in all life sciences it has also had an enormous impact on science in general, philosophy, religion, and politics the last 150 years. In this course, some of the major concepts and problems of evolutionary biology, such as fitness, adaptation, the structure of the evolutionary theory, the problem of the units of selection, the species problem, are presented and examined from a philosophical perspective.
COURSE OBJECTIVES: At the end of this course, the student will have learned:
basic concepts about the evolutionary theory, such as natural selection, fitness, adaptation;
basic philosophical problems related with the evolutionary theory, such as nature of biological laws/models, biological explanations, the creationism-evolution debate, the tautology problem, reduction, biological teleology, the units of selection problem, the problems about adaptationism, the species problem, biological determinism, evolution of morality and culture.

PHIL248: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Generally speaking, medieval philosophy is taken to run from around the fifth through fifteenth centuries CE, roughly corresponding to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire through the beginning of the Renaissance, which itself is taken as running from the mid-fourteenth through mid-seventeenth centuries. These two periods, then, overlap. To the extent they can be genuinely teased apart, the medieval period is marked by adherence to monotheistic religious tenets and authority as well as to Aristotle, while the Renaissance sees the rediscovery of pre-Christian thought and a decreasing reliance on prior texts and thinkers. However, none of these qualifications can be taken as fully descriptive of either period and their similarities and differences will become apparent in equal measure as we move through the material.
As this is a survey course covering approximately 1200 years of philosophy, it is impossible to do justice to either period, more so than in other survey courses. That said, we will read many of their most important thinkers. We begin with Augustine of Hippo (354-430) and his sermon on the sacking of Rome in 410. We then move to selections from the Roman senator Boethius (477-524); the great Islamic philosophers Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 980-1037) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes, 1126-1198); and the high watermarks of medieval Christian thought as found in Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) and John Duns Scotus (1265/6-1308). With that, we move into the Renaissance with readings from Nicholas of Cusa’s (1401-1464) On Learned Ignorance, Niccolò Machivelli’s (1469-1527) Prince, Martin Luther’s (1483-1546) “Ninety-five Theses,” the Coimbra Commentaries (1591-1606), and closing with Francisco Suárez’s (1548-1617) Metaphysical Disputations.
 
Survey of post-Aristotelian and medieval philosophies. philosophy in the Renaissance; Humanism; controversy between the Platonists and the Aristotelians; scepticism, and Reformation.

PHIL282: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. COURSE DESCRIPTION: The Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection is one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the modern era. Although it is a theory of biology with its revolutionary consequences in all life sciences it has also had an enormous impact on science, philosophy, religion, and politics for the last 150 years. In this course, as we examine the evolutionary thinking by the work of a number of key representative figures in the past and present we will also be questioning as to whether scientific theories, in general, and the evolutionary theory, in particular, are social constructions by searching for values inherent in scientific theories and research.
COURSE OBJECTIVES: The aim of this course is to demonstrate students by concrete examples from the history of evolutionary biology that, although science involves social (nonscientific/epistemic) values both in discovering and testing scientific theories, it, nevertheless, progresses and achieves objective knowledge by removing these values from science.
COURSE TOPICS: Problem of objectivity and subjectivity in science, epistemic (scientific) and non-epistemic (social) values in science, the role of metaphors in science.
 
Problems of the development of science through history.

PHIL343: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Course intended mainly for 3rd and 4th year students in Philosophy. However, 2nd year students may get enrolled as well. Moreover, there may be a small room for students of other departments, who are seriously interested in the course.
 
Course Syllabus: This course contains a substantial reading component. The purpose of this course is to improve students’ reading skills needed for philosophy as well as to discuss what philosophical activity is all about by studying Plato’s dialogue the Meno, and by doing so we shall study Plato’s philosophy and shed some light on what he might understand this activity.
 
This course firstly aims at introducing you to the practice of reading in philosophy by studying thoroughly a text in the Western philosophical tradition. Students will also get to grasp some problems that have been significant to philosophy from its beginnings, the major one of which is the problem of knowledge. In the process of thoroughly studying the text and the arguments appearing in the text, you will develop your own philosophical and analytical skills.
 
As for Plato’s philosophy and his understanding of what this activity entails, the course will also include instruction in finding and defining problems, formulating questions to capture the problems defined, arrangement, developing arguments, revision, and strategies of research.
 
 
The course will be concerned with the selected dialogues of Plato. After a brief introduction to Plato`s conception of Socratic 2410osophizing (in Apology, Crito, Euthyphro) we will trace the development of Plato`s ethical theory from the Socratic ethics of the Protagoras to the Platonic ethics of the Republic; and Plato`s metaphysical theory from the Meno and Phaedo to the Republic and Timaeus. Finally, some attention will be given to his theory of knowledge in the later dialogues, especially the Theaetetus, the Parmenides, and the Sophist.

This semester (2021-2022 Fall), the main objective will be to cover a number of Aristotelian subjects, especially concerning his theory of being and theory of mind. The main objective will be to familiarize students with Aristotle's concepts of truth (aletheia) and intellect (nous).
Please also note that in line with the partial normalization process, the classes this term (2021-2022 Fall) will be hybrid: they will be held both in person and also online on Zoom.
 
The course will be concerned with Aristotle`s most famous and influential work Metaphysics. After a brief introduction to Aristotle`s philosophy and its place in the history of ancient philosophy, we will pay particular attention to Aristotle`s conception of `first philosophy` as the most valuable and comprehensive of all sciences, the so-called `metaphysics`. We will trace how Aristotle explores the science that is devoted to the investigation of first causes, of Being as  such and of the form of knowledge that deserves the title `wisdom`. Finally, we will consider Aristotle`s formulation of the fundamental metaphysical problems: the questions concerning the substance, the particular and the universal, form and matter, potentiality and actuality, and finally, the mover and the moved.

PHIL390: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Some of the central philosophical problems of science highlighted by the success, methods and social settings of modern science.
Topics and problems to be covered throughout the course will be selected from the following list –not all topics may be covered in any one semester:
* What is special about the scientific method? What constitutes a scientific approach to investigating the world? Why be scientific? Science vs. pseudo-science or good vs. bad science.
* Does science make inductive assumptions? Does it simply generalise from the cases already investigated? If so, how are such inductive assumptions to be justified?
* Can evidence ever establish scientific theories? If not, what exact role does empirical testing play in science? The role of experiment in the scientific method; the Duhem-Quine Problem; the empirical basis of science; weight of evidence and predictive success.
* Are there any special problems concerned with testing statistical or probabilistic theories?
* Scientific explanation; what are ad hoc explanations and moves? Why should they be avoided in science?
* What is the status of presently accepted scientific theories? The problem of theory-choice (or theory-change) and scientific rationality. What are revolutionary-theory-changes in science? How do revolutionary-theory-changes in science affect the view that science consists of a body of established truths? And how does the phenomenon of revolutionary changes in science affect traditional notions of scientific rationality? Do scientific revolutions involve changes in scientific methodology?
 
Historical and epistemological evaluation of some rationality theories, e.g., Popper`s Falsificationism, Kuhn`s Scientific Revolutions, Feyerabend`s Liberalism, Lakatos`s MSRP and Structural Realism.

PHIL392: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Course Intended for students of Philosophy and other Departments.
 
Course Syllabus: This course, while providing a philosophical and historical account of how non-Euclidean geometries were discovered, deals with some important methodological and historical problems of geometry such as the possibility of methodology of non-empirical sciences, continuity and progress in geometry with special emphasis on case studies in geometry.
 
Course Content: The discovery of non-Euclidean geometries has a long and complicated history. The predominant account of this discovery claims that this history is a linear compilation of geometrical results and should be best understood as a sequence of foundational studies. Moreover, it does not deal with the issues of rationality geometrical progress and revolutions in the history of geometry. So it has some weakness to represent faithfully what went on when such a discovery came about. An historical-cum-methodological account of this discovery shall be offered in terms of methods employed by geometers in problem-solving, the characterization of geometrical language, problems and theories, and the intentions of geometers themselves. Euclid’s and Saccheri’s works will be studied as case studies.
 
Pre-Requisites: Some familiarity with logic and the philosophy and history of science.
 
Written Work, Oral Presentation and Examination: tba.
 
 
 
History of the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries; historical and methodological problems of geometrical progress.
