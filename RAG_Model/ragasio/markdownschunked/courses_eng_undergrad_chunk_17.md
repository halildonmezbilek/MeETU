ADM3103: This course belongs to department of POLITICAL SCIENCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. This course surveys the literature on political participation and electoral systems. After briefly recapping the universe of representation theories and electoral systems in the world, we will delve into the multiple strands of the literature on voting theories. We will then turn to political parties and political regimes, both of which are crucial to understand theories of political participation. We will finally focus on alternative notions and forms of political participation in today’s world, including polities and politics in the age of populism, the rise of social movements and civil society in the world, and old and new forms of citizenship.
All in all, the course is expected to equip students with both the classical and contemporary studies of political participation. We will dovetail theoretical readings with empirical pieces so as to better get the sense of the course material. There are many weeks in which we will focus on the Turkish case (most with a comparative angle) to increase the immersion of the students to the course material. At the end of the course, given that the students put sufficient effort to the course, the students are expected to have a much better understanding of political participation and electoral systems, both theoretically and empirically.  
 
This course aims to familiarize the students with basic issues of political participation.  A basic distinction is made between conventional means of participation such as political parties, interest and pressure groups, elections and voting on the one hand, and unconventional means of participation such as terrorism, new social movements, post-modernity and cyber democracy on the other.

ADM3136: This course belongs to department of POLITICAL SCIENCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. At the end of this course the students are expected to acquire the following knowledge, skills and competencies:
1) Comprehensive knowledge of the classical and contemporary theories and approaches to modernity in social sciences.
2) Critical capacity to compare, interprete and apply various perpsectives of modernity to the contemporary conditions of various societies.
3) Creative use of the recently proposed concepts, terms and visions in the interdisciplinary studies of modernity in contemporary social sciences. 
 
This course aims to introduce and discuss changing conceptions of modernity in social and political theory from the mid-19th / early 20th to the early 21st century. The mediating dynamic of change between the conceptions of early and late modernity is described through changes in the political-economic organization of capitalism. This can be summed up as the transformation of nationally organized capitalism towards a disorganized, global capitalism. In the new sociology of the late-modern societies it is argued that contemporary societies take new forms and undergo new experiences as they are exposed to global uncertainties and complexity arising from the decomposition of organized capitalism. This course is designed with the expectation that the students will have a comprehensive understanding of changing forms of modernity from its inception to its novel forms in contemporary times.
