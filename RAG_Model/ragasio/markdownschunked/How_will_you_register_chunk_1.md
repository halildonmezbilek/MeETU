Question: Registrations of Students Continuing Their Program (Graduate and Undergraduate Programs, the Higher Vocational School)
Answer: Students continuing Undergraduate and Graduate programs should make the interactive registration. 
It is strongly recommended that the students should check the courses completed and the courses taken via Student Portal number 61 “Student Semester Details” under the section of “curriculum”. In case of a problem, students should contact the program advisors from the Registrar’s Office.
For students who will enroll in the 2nd semester of the Master's with Thesis Program and the 3rd semester of the Doctorate Program; Before the interactive registration and advisor approval dates specified in the Academic Calendar, it is obligatory to appoint a thesis advisor via program no. 71 (thesis advisor appointment program) among the full-time faculty members of our University. These students are required to register for the "thesis and thesis work" courses of the assigned thesis advisor each semester, starting from the interactive registration and advisor approval process of the period in which the thesis advisor is appointed.
Students who take additional time (correction) by the thesis jury by defending the thesis at any stage of the graduate program have to renew their registrations during additional periods (correction periods). These students are required to register for the new semester by paying the tuition fee/tuition fee and getting the approval of the advisor.

## Entry 2834

Question: Registrations of Students to Double Major/Minor Programs
Answer: During the admission process of newly admitted students to the Double Major / Minor Programs, the courses that were counted for adaptation, if any, were added to their programs by the Registrar’s Office. Students must register for both of their major and double major/minor programs separately and get approvals from advisors in both departments. Accepted students will contact the coordinators of Double Major / Minor Programs for both the courses they need to take and get registered at Add-Drop and Advisor Approval dates announced on the Academic Calendar (https://oidb.metu.edu.tr/en/academic-calendar). If a student takes a course for both majors or major and minor programs, s/he should register for this course separately for each program and get advisor approval for each program separately. They will also follow the same procedure for replacement.
Common compulsory courses of the major and double major/minor programs must be taken in the same semester for both programs. Therefore, the system will not allow dropping a common compulsory course registered in one of the programs for which the registration approval has been obtained. If registration approval is not obtained, the course will be automatically dropped in one program when it is dropped in the other.
Admitted students must enroll in their double major or minor programs each semester. If they do not register, they are dismissed from the double major/minor program by the registrar's office. Students who did not register and do not want to lose their registration rights should notify their requests to the relevant department for permission. 
Students who were registered in Double Major or Minor programs in the previous semesters and were accepted to Double Major or Minor programs again must delete their registration from their previous programs (as they cannot enroll in two Minor and two Double Major programs at the same time).
