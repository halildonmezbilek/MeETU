Question: MICROSOFT 365 
Answer: 


— MICROSOFT 365 —
Eligible staff and students can sign up for Microsoft 365 (formerly known as Office 365) for the classroom for free, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Microsoft Teams, plus additional classroom tools for the duration of their time at the university.
Microsoft 365 is licensed as part of your METU email account.
Important Note: In line with the global policy change by Microsoft, the OneDrive storage space offered to Microsoft Office 365 users within the corporate storage area will no longer be available. In this context, to prevent possible data loss, we recommend that you back up your data on OneDrive to an external storage area and free up this space until August 1, 2024.


Important Notice-3! 
If Microsoft 365 applications are to be used for the first time, you should register with the METU user account xxxxxx@metu.edu.tr via https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/office and follow the specified steps.
If you have previously registered with Microsoft 365 applications with the METU user account xxxxxx@metu.edu.tr; to download and install these applications on personal devices, you should log in to https://www.microsoft365.com/ with the METU user account xxxxxx@metu.edu.tr used during Microsoft registration and the Microsoft password created for this.
Due to the Microsoft infrastructure change announced in our university in the past months, our users who have previously created a Microsoft registration as xxxxxx@metu.edu.tr may encounter an error when logging in to Microsoft 365 applications in the newly switched infrastructure. This error is caused by old sessions opened and registered to Microsoft services that were previously installed on the computer. Our users who experience login errors can follow the steps below as recommended by Microsoft:
For Windows users:
Press windows key + R to open the Run, Type %localappdata%/Microsoft and Enter.
Delete  OneAuth  and IdentityCache folder from there.
Open credential manager and click on the click on the windows credentials.
Delete all the generic credentials related to office 365.
Open Registry editor and follow the path HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office<16.0>\Common\Identity.
Delete the identity folder.
Restart the computer and try to log into the apps.
For MAC users:
Delete the office suite and install it again.
If it does not work, use the following steps to delete the cache.
Method-1
Open Finder and press Shift + Command + G to open the Go to folder window.
Type      /Library/Containers//com.Microsoft.OsfWebHost/Data/  and press Go.
Select all files in this folder and delete them.
Method-2
Using terminal type the following command      rm -rf /Library/Containers/com.Microsoft.OsfWebHost/Data/*    and press enter
If the login error persists due to these steps, a support request can be made via https://bilisimdestek.metu.edu.tr/


Important Notice-2! 
Dear Members,

Recent announcements have shared that Microsoft will globally change its licensing policies, and therefore, it has become necessary to implement a two-phase adjustment in our current Microsoft software services.

In the first stage, as stated in the announcement, required members benefiting from Office 365 services to individually back up/delete all their data on OneDrive, Teams, and other Microsoft services.

The second stage, to be carried out between June 24 and July 1, 2024, involves discontinuing the Office 365 A1 Plus licenses used in our university and providing access to new licenses through a new infrastructure.

As part of the second stage, there will be planned restrictions on access to existing Microsoft services during the specified dates. Disruptions may occur when logging into Microsoft Teams, Office 365 software, and other Microsoft services. After the stage is completed on July 1, 2024, all our members will be able to access Microsoft services via their new "@metu.edu.tr" email addresses (e.g., for staff: namesurname@metu.edu.tr // for students: e123456@metu.edu.tr) and new access passwords, which they will obtain by following the "Forgot my password" steps, through the new infrastructure.

After the transition to the new infrastructure, it will not be possible to access data in the old infrastructure using the "@metu.edu.tr" Microsoft accounts and new access passwords. Members wishing to access their data in the old infrastructure will be able to log into Microsoft services with temporarily created "@metu2.metu.edu.tr" email addresses (e.g., for staff: namesurname@metu2.metu.edu.tr // for students: e123456@metu2.metu.edu.tr) and their old Microsoft account passwords. The old infrastructure accounts will remain available for a while to allow members to back up their old data.

Detailed information on the subject can be accessed at https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/microsoft365. Possible questions or issues can be submitted via https://bilisimdestek.metu.edu.tr/.

We present this information for your attention.

Regards,
Computer Center


Important Notice-1! 
Dear All,
Microsoft has announced that it will make global changes to its licensing policies. As part of these changes, the Office 365 A1 Plus licenses currently used at our university will be discontinued, and the 1 TB OneDrive, Exchange, and SharePoint cloud storage capacity, which is recognized on a user basis, will no longer be available.
To ensure uninterrupted access to Microsoft software for university members, it is mandatory to make adjustments in our existing Microsoft software services based on the announced changes.
In the first stage, the 1 TB OneDrive, Exchange, and SharePoint quotas recognized on a user basis in Office 365 accounts associated with our members’ @metu.edu.tr email addresses will be restricted as of June 30, 2024. Therefore, members benefiting from Office 365 services need to individually back up or delete their OneDrive, Teams accounts (including records and channels), and all data in Microsoft services by this date. Failure to take action by the specified date will make the account owner responsible for any service interruptions or data loss in Office 365 accounts. If the relevant data in Office 365 accounts continues to be stored without any backup or deletion, there is a possibility that Microsoft may delete this data, and access to it may not be possible after some time.
Details of the planned adjustments related to Microsoft software services in the second stage will be announced later.
For more detailed information on this topic, you can visithttps://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/microsoft365 .
We sincerely appreciate your attention.
Best regards,
Computer Center

Question: How can I use METU e-mail forwarding?
Answer: 

METU Alumni and former METU staff can continue to receive e-mails sent to their METU e-mail addresses by activating the e-mail forwarding to another e-mail address they have.

Users will receive reminder e-mails 1 month before their user codes are to be terminated, informing them about the user code termination and the necessary steps for e-mail forwarding. After receiving this e-mail, they can activate e-mail forwarding with the last password they use. To activate "e-mail forwarding" service, please visit METU Portal. You can also activate forwarding via https://forward.metu.edu.tr.

After the activation of e-mail forwarding, new e-mails sent to your METU e-mail address will be automatically forwarded to the e-mail address you indicated. E-mail forwarding is not valid for already received e-mails in your inbox. If you want to archive those e-mails, please visit this link. If your METU user code has been terminated in the last 4 weeks, you can apply for backup.
To activate e-mail forwarding, you need to log in with your METU user code and password. After logging in, you can type in the e-mail address you want your METU e-mail address to be redirected to, in the Forward e-mail to text box and click Update. Then, your e-mail forwarding is activated. To deactivate e-mail forwarding, please click Forwarding on or off button.

What should you do if you cannot access your usercode?

If your user code had been terminated and you do not remember your password, please send a photo of your identity card (only the front side) and indicate your student number / staff ID number and the forwarding address you prefer via the IT Support Form. (allowed file types in the form are: pdf, png, jpeg, gif and maximum file upload size: 2MB ) Then, Computer Center IT Support Team will activate your e-mail forwarding service. You will receive an automatic e-mail once your e-mail forwarding is activated.
E-mail forwarding serves only the purpose to forward the e-mails sent to your METU e-mail address to another e-mail address you specify. No e-mails can be sent via your METU e-mail address.

## Entry 2676

Question: I cannot send a message from my METU account to an external e-mail address which has been directed to an address in METU. Why?
Answer: 

E-mail messages sent from a usermetu.edu.tr structured e-mail address to an e-mail address with the same structure; in other words, e-mail messages with "usermetu.edu.tr" for both the "To:" and "From:" fields (the sender and the recipient are the same) are blocked unless they are sent via "mail.metu.edu.tr" server.
This procedure is applied in order to block the unwanted messages from out of campus sources, like fake and/or spam messages, to be distributed.
For this reason, when you direct the e-mail account provided by an email service provider from outside of METU to the e-mail address with the METU central user code, e-mail messages sent from an account with a METU field name will be classified as fake/spam e-mail and blocked by the central servers since it will be conveyed through a server which is out of campus.
Important: Directing from departmental e-mail accounts (e.g. xxxxx.metu.edu.tr) is not within the scope and therefore is not blocked.

## Entry 2678

Question: If I encounter a Turkish character problem when sending and taking e-mails, what should I do? (In Turkish)
Answer: 

Sunucu sistemlerimiz e-posta alışverişinde Türkçe karakterleri desteklemektedir. Horde ve Squirrelmail arayüzlerine Türkçe olarak girildiğinde gönderilen e-postaların karakter seti ISO-8859-9, İngilizce olarak girildiğinde ise UTF-8'dir. Her iki karakter seti de Türkçe karakterleri içermektedir. UTF-8’de Türkçe dışındaki kimi dillere özel karakterler de bulunmaktadır.
Not: Horde arayüzünde e-posta gönderirken "Karakter Seti" alanındaki seçenekleri kullanarak bu ayarı değiştirmek mümkündür.
Horde ya da Squirrelmail arayüzü dışında Outlook Express, Thunderbird ya da Windows Mail benzeri herhangi bir POP3/IMAP istemcisi ile e-posta gönderiyorsanız gönderilen e-postanın karakter seti, ilgili programın kendi ayarlarına bağlı olarak belirlenir.
Giden e-postalar için karakter seti değişikliği yapmak için farklı programlarda izlenen yol aşağıdaki gibidir (aşağıda yer almayan farklı programlar için de karakter seti ayarları benzer yerlerdedir):
Outlook Express ve Windows Mail için: Tools → Options → Send → International Settings (Araçlar → Seçenekler → Gönder → Uluslararası Ayarlar)
Mozilla Thunderbird için: Tools → Options → Display → Fonts → Character Encodings (Araçlar → Seçenekler → Görünüm → Yazıtipleri → Karakter Kodlaması)
Göndereceğiniz e-postada Türkçe karakter kullanmak istiyorsanız söz konusu menülerdeki ayarları ISO-8859-9 (Türkçe ISO olarak da tanımlanır) ya da UTF-8 seçmeniz yeterlidir.
Size gelen e-postalardaki Türkçe karakterleri görmekte sorun yaşıyorsanız iki farklı durum sözkonusu olabilir.
Karşı taraf e-posta gönderirken ya da kendisine gelen e-postayı yönlerken Türkçe karakterleri desteklemeyen bir karakter seti kullanmıştır. Bu durumda gelen mesaj düzgün olarak görüntülenemez. Örneğin metinde Türkçe karakter kullanıldığı halde gönderilirken ISO-8859-1 karakter seti kullanılmış ise söz konusu karakter seti Türkçe karakterleri desteklemediği için e-postanın düzgün olarak görüntülenmesi mümkün değildir.
Gönderilen e-posta düzgün karakter seti ile gönderilmiş olmasına karşın kullandığınız programın ayarları farklı olabilir. Bu durumda kullanılan programın ayarlarının değiştirilmesi mesajın düzgün şekilde okunmasını sağlayacaktır. Horde ya da Squirrelmail kullanarak e-posta okuyan kullanıcılarımızın kullandıkları tarayıcı programında, Outlook Express, Thunderbird ya da Windows Mail benzeri herhangi bir POP3/IMAP istemcisi ile e-posta gönderen kullanıcılarımızın ise ilgili programdaki karakter seti ayarlarını değiştirmeleri gerekmektedir.
Gelen e-postalar için karakter seti değişikliği yapmak için farklı programlarda izlenen yol aşağıdaki gibidir (aşağıda yer almayan farklı programlar için de karakter seti ayarları benzer yerlerdedir):
Internet Explorer, Outlook Express ve Windows Mail için: View → Encoding (Görünüm → Kodlama)
Mozilla Firefox ve Mozilla Thunderbird için: View → Character Encoding (Göster → Karakter Kodlaması)

Question: Is there a limit of my account for the Inbox directory or the other directories I have created for the e-mail messages or the other files I would like to keep?
Answer: 

The disk space allocated for user account owners on the central servers is designated as quota. Two different quota areas are allocated for METU users and their capacities are independent from each other. The e-mail messages you may keep in the Inbox or other e-mail directories you have created are limited with the e-mail messages quota and the files in other directories to be created are limited by the file quota.

## Entry 2691

Question: What is the difference between POP3 and IMAP accounts?
Answer: 

POP and IMAP are communication protocols that download your e-mails to your personal computer or other devices.
POP3It provides basic downloading and deleting actions. E-mail service providers who use POP usually take actions as follows; connect to the server, get all the messages, keep those messages on the user’s device and delete them from the server, disconnect to server. Therefore, when mails are also deleted from the device, they are no longer available. However, some e-mail service providers may provide an option to archive those messages in a new folder. POP3 supports only one user at a time. In fact, if you connect to your account from a second device then it disconnects the first one.
IMAPWhen several devices are connected to a mail service provider at the same time, IMAP protocol prevent some possible problems with these devices to occur. Unlikely to POP, IMAP provides bidirectional communication. Thus, some possible problems are inhibited that may occur while connecting on web, synchronizing from mobile devices, getting e-mails from computer. The most useful function of IMAP is that when you move a mail to a new folder then it updates all the connected devices. All the modifications are updated from all connected devices synchronously.
