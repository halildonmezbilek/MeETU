BA4104: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. Here are the words of  Serdar Devrim from Hürriyet Ä°K, dated     June 7, 2015   “Neden olmuyor acaba?” 
“ You have looked through his CV, his LinkedIn account, called his references, searched for his traces on social media, invited him for an interview 2-3 times to test his patience and nerves, and, finally, you have hired the CEO’s wife’s best friend’s daughter…
Just kidding! You have found the one who is closest to being the right person for the right job and hired him. Depending, of course, on how lucky you were(!). You have agreed on salary, benefits, working conditions and the actual job to be done, and shaken hands. 
 
Let’s say; you are great manager, a superb HR person and you knew very well what you wanted and who you were looking for. You carried out the recruitment process perfectly.
Still yet, every hire is a gamble, a dice-roll, getting a double-six has a probability of 1 in 36. There will for sure be some lack of knowledge and objectivity.
The situation is the same for the hired personnel. How well did she introduce herself? Besides, how well does she know herself? How deliberately, objectively and well did she decide? How well did she know the company? How well did she understand what is expected from her? etc, etc…
 
             The interviewing process is a kind of sales activity. In this case, you are the product and the salesperson. In this course you are going to practice how to “sell” yourself  to your prospective employer.  An interview of 15-30 minutes could change all your professional carrier, even your life; like the university exam you had entered 4 years ago.
 
This course aims to enhance the student`s ability to secure a job that matches his or her values, interests and skills. The course also focuses on developing job interviewing and presentation skills.

The fundamental principle of a quality ecosystem is interdependence, i.e. something that happens in one part of the system may affect other parts within the system. Excellent organisations have some facets as sustainability, profitability, social responsibility, reputation and good governance. In achieving this, the contemporary manager is faced with the challenge of first making a healthy diagnosis of his/her organization and plan for change to achieve a successful transition to excellence.  Self-assessment approach used by quality award winner companies (like Motorola, AT&T, BT, GM, Nokia, Chevron, Marriot, Brisa, Kordsa, Arçelik, NetaÅ, Vitra, Bilim Ä°laç, and universities) is well as excellence advocates will be discussed as part of planning process.
 
Concepts of quality improvement as developed by Deming, Juran, Imai and others are covered in depth. Concept of achieving company-wide quality control, total quality Management, continuous quality improvement are among the topics stressed in this course. Recent developments in quality Management theories are studied. Similarities and differences between philosophies, approaches and tools of quality Management are pointed out.
