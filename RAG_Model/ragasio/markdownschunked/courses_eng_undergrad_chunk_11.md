CRP355: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF CITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING. The course is for third and fourth year undergraduate students in City and Regional Planning (‘urban design’ module) aand those from the Department of Architecture. The course, in this context, aims to provide the planning students with the basic knowledge on architectural typologies (especially for a better understanding of designing urban form) while providing the architectural students with the fundamental principles of residential planning and design. The course invites students reconsider the existing trends in ecological perspectives to the quality standards of life in the residential areas within a renewed comprehension of the idea of ‘neighborhood’. In this regard, the course also aims to support students to specialize on the design dimension of urbanism from a multi-disciplinary perspective.
 
The course addresses the complexities of designing the living environments of cities and develops an understanding on collective housing along with the corresponding programs of social facilities and activity patterns. While providing students with the basic knowledge on architectural typologies of housing, the course aims to handle the problem of housing as a practice of spatial planning and design in urban context. As an experimental workshop, the course searches for a constructive relationship between architecture and urban design by generating rich, diverse and coherent housing areas as alternative to the current discourse and practice of mass housing.

CRP495: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF CITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING. The terms “urban” and “politics” went hand in hand throughout the history. As Lefebvre puts: “There is politics of space because space is political”. Urban life embraced power and politics from the very emergence of the human settlements. The aim of this course is to introduce the students to the basic concepts and theories of political power, state, local state and their analysis in urban context. The course is organized into three parts. The first part is devoted to the methodological problems which is indispensable for the scientific analysis of social and political issues. Such an introduction is a must, to comprehend, evaluate and debate the material presented in the latter sections of the course properly. Part two examines in a summary manner the theories developed about the state (i.e. the ultimate organization of political power) in general and the capitalist state in particular. Part three deals with the local state, the role played by and functions fulfilled by the state in urban context. The course will be conducted in a lecturedemonstration mode. Readings are to be regarded as reference material, “suggested” rather than “required”. Because of the length of the overall list, students will be expected to read selectively- choosing some areas for intensive reading and others for skimming according to particular interests.

ECE356: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. This course will introduce students the importance of outdoor education for young children. Moreover, the characteristics of ideal outdoor environment, risk and safety in outdoor environment will be studied. The course will also focus on the pedagogies related to nature-based education, the relation between sustainability and outdoor education. In addition, participants in this course will be provided strategies to plan planning outdoor activities for young children and effective teacher strategies in outdoor environments.
 
 
The importance of outdoor play is widely acknowledged by early childhood researchers.  However, studies, which are conducted to investigate teachers outdoor play practices, proposed educational implications in relation to in-service and pre-service training programs about outdoor education. They suggested that in-service and pre-service teacher training programs are needed about facilitation of childrens outdoor play by teachers. As those researchers indicated, in-service teacher training could be one way to form teachers beliefs and improve their outdoor play practices. However, when teachers are graduated from university and participated to the regular system, they have generally configured their beliefs in relation to teaching and learning. When it is considered that beliefs are resistant to change, the role of pre-service teacher training programs in constructing pre-service teachers beliefs becomes more crucial. In other words, pre-service teacher training programs might be more effective to construct pre-service teachers beliefs of outdoor education and to make them capable in terms of facilitating childrens outdoor play and learning. In this regard, several research that have been conducted to examine the role of pre-service teacher training programs in forming pre-service teachers beliefs constitute an evidence for this foresight. From this point of view, providing an outdoor education course for pre-service teachers would be golden opportunity to train qualified and capable students in the issue of outdoor education. In addition, in Turkey, curriculum for early childhood education suggested teachers to conduct learning activities in outdoor environment as much as possible. Based on this guide curriculum, teachers are expected to create their own plans. At that point, as the teachers will be decision makers of the curriculum and classroom it is important to make pre-service students to develop positive attitudes toward outdoor education. Due to aforementioned reasons, presenting a course for outdoor education is significant for pre-service early childhood teacher training program.

We will discuss the issues, which have been the traditional focus of sociology, such as the emergence of modernity and capitalism, industrialization and urbanization, as well as relatively newer subjects such as the emergence of politics of race, ethnicity, gender and sexual preferences etc. Although we will cover a wide variety of topics, we will focus more thoroughly on different forms of inequalities of the contemporary world based on various axes of social difference such as social class, race, ethnicity and gender.
 
The course will be based on a mixture of lecture and discussion, therefore being present in class and showing intellectual engagement with the issues at hand has a vital role in determining your grade. During the lectures, I will not confine my self to the textbook, and will make use of other material, which will not be available to those who are absent. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to come to class and take notes.
 
An introduction to basic principles, concepts and theories of  sociology; analysis of social structure, cultural processes and patterns; the relationship of the individual to society.  Emphasis on  case studies.

SOC109: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY. Mills opens his well-known piece on the promise of sociology by defining a problem of his age, “Nowadays men often feel that their private lives are a series of traps. They sense that within their everyday worlds, they cannot overcome their troubles, and in this feeling, they are often quite correct” (1959, p. 1). Social phenomena and related “traps” have become increasingly complicated in the age of globalization. Consequently, sociology, as a disciple undertaking the task of riddling such traps, expanded its scope of application through different disciplines and professions.

Although anthropology had built a reputation for producing the knowledge of “other” people’s culture, thoughts and behaviors; the discipline already made its home-coming several decades ago. Since then, anthropological perspectives and methods have gradually become of importance to understand and compete with highly diversified socio-cultural encounters in the contemporary world. Today, the Kula traders of New Guiana can help us to understand financial markets and crises (Keir Martin, Guardian – 23.04.2012). For this reason, developing an anthropological understanding would be critical for anyone who would like to participate in global society.

Disasters are fundamentally sociological events. First of all, the course will try to discuss how to sociologically conceptualize  what a `disaster`is? what is a `hazard`? What is a`hazard risk`? Why we cannot justify the term `natural` to explain disasters? How can we understand the root drivers behind disasters? The course will then continue with a brief analysis of different theoretical discussions and sociological perspectives for understanding disasters? The course will continue explaining how disasters may enhance the previous social inequalities before and may lead to multidimensional, contextual and intersectional vulnerabilities during and after the disasters. The course will then focus on the difference between `disaster risk management` and `disaster risk reduction` approaches. While the first one is emphasizing the period after a disaster, the later refers to preventive strategies, referring to risk perception, awareness and preparedness. The role of NGOs will be also covered in the course. Especially there will be a discussion on whether we can talk of a  `recovery` or a major social change after a disaster. In the course, various major disasters experienced in the world will be presented. Among them disaster/climate change induced migration will be particularly emphasized.
