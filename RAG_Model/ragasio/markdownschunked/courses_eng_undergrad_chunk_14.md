introduce project finance as a technique to raise long-term financing for capital intensive projects on a limited or non-recourse basis,


provide a clearly defined framework for designing, appraising and structuring project finance deals,


provide tools to identify and manage risks in project finance transactions,


present financial modeling techniques to bring together all the elements of the course to make informed decisions in project financing.


 
This course provides a firm foundation on project finance, which is a product of financial engineering to raise long-term financing for large capital intensive projects. This recently and rapidly developed technique has become common throughout the world during the last couple of decades in the face of enormous infrastructure needs of both developed and developing countries. Project finance has the potential of offering distinct advantages over corporate finance in certain cases especially for large and risky projects, and this potential makes it particularly interesting. However, it has also its own complexities, which need to be managed properly in each stage of a deal if this potential is to be realized.Therefore,the objectives of this course are to:

FLE235: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION. This course is designed to familiarise students with some of the most striking examples from British prose through the end of the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries. Selected examples focus on gothic fiction, modernist fiction, feminist non-fiction, postmodern novel, and postcolonial novel, ranging from epistolary format to various other narrative styles. Each text will be analysed formally in terms of their narrative aspects, with constant references to their historical and literary backgrounds as well as their cultural contexts. Students will be provided with information on the use of narrative analysis tools, and they are expected to make use of these tools in their analyses of the texts. Lectures on the introductory bodies, which will be supported by visual materials, will be followed by student-centred in-class discussions. 
 
This course focuses on British prose fiction from 1900 to the Second World War. After an introduction to the philosophical, political and economic background and to the arguments of Modernism, some of the main characteristics of Modernist art and of  modern fiction in more general terms  are studied in relation to works by such writers as James, Conrad, Wells, Bennett, Woolf, Joyce, Mansfield, Forster, Greene. The extent to which modern literary theories are responses to Modernist Fiction is discussed.

FLE315: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION. At the end of this course, the student will learn:

major formal and thematic features of the formal realist, modernist, postcolonial and postmodern novel
basic tools and theories of literary analysis

 
The years from the Great Exhibition (1851) to the Second Reform Bill (1867) were a period of enormous vitality in the English novel. Major works by Dickens, Thackeray, Charlotte Bronte, Trollope, George Eliot, Gaskell, and others capitalized on the burgeoning of serial publication and circulating libraries; on unprecedented growth of consumer capitalism at home and imperial dominance abroad; on worshipful audiences ranging from distinguished literary critics, to eminent leaders of society and politics, to vast numbers of middle and lower class readers. The result was a novel of confident power and narrative scope. By focusing on this period, we are able to survey many of the major authors of Victorian fiction while attending closely to a specific set of historical developments, class relations, and gender issues. The aim of the course is to instruct the students about the characteristics of novel as a literary genre and to show the classroom techniques for teaching the realist novel and to introduce them to the Victorian novel by close study of major texts from this period.

ECON108: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS. This course aims to provide economics students with an introduction to the fundamental constituents of economics from a historical perspective. The course has its focus on a particular topic for each week and explores it through an overview of its historical development and a discussion of the theories and debates that have characterized its study and evolution down to the present time. The course pays particular attention to the specificities of time and space in treating each topic and encourages students to develop awareness that they are all historically constructed and the study of each is in fact a practical exercise in understanding human beings and the world. The primary objective of this course is to cultivate a social science perspective for a thorough comprehension of each topic and then help students develop a more intellectual understanding of economics as a discipline that cuts across much of social sciences and humanities.
