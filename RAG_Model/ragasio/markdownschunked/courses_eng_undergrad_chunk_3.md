CRP447: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF CITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING. Course aims to develop a critical look at past and contemporary discussions on spatial planning and development. 
 
The course is divided into four parts. The first one aims to bring together the theory and approaches that contribute to the growth and development of contemporary cities. A historical outline of the transition from modern to postmodem city will be provided by focusing on changing economic, social and cultural aspects of urban daily life. In the second part, the focus will be directed to the planning and development issues. Reading materials will be provided to discuss the paradigm shift within planning and development facing with previously mentioned economic, social and cultural changes. After establishing the background with the first and second parts, the course will focus on some contemporary issues in the third part. Urban policies and planning implementations, some producing negative outcomes others carrying potential to overcome experienced problems will be the subject matter of this part. The fourth and the final part of the course will consist of student presentations that are related to the analysis of national and international policies contributing to the development and planning of contemporary cities. Case studies from Turkey and international contexts will be guestioned with the help of framework provided at the beginning of the course.

CRP448: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF CITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING. No objective 
Food is our fuel for existence and the symbolic center of our lives. Food is not only a bare necessity, it is also the medium through which knowledge, tradition and even history are transmitted, known and shared by all. The concept of ?foodscapes? emerged in the 1990s within the context of studies of social and spatial inequalities in public health and food systems. Since then, it has incorporated the study of the entire chain of food from its production to consumption especially in the context of changing notions of landscape and space. This course intends to introduce the term 'foodscape' as a part of urban studies. The term and its connotations will be explored through various aspects of urban and rural life; it is not just a material space, but includes socio-political processes. The course aims to investigate how food shapes and is shaped by the spatial characteristics of urban and rural environments, considering the historical, cultural, and socio-economic factors that contribute to the diversity of food experiences in places. Different approaches, such as analytical, systematical, or phenomenological, will be explored to develop a holistic spatial approach to urban and rural foodscapes. Each week, examples from around the world will be presented around specific themes to enrich the understanding of general concepts.
Throughout the course, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the spatial intricacies that define a city's culinary identity. The course encourages a critical examination of the role of food in shaping the urban experience whereby the students will critically analyze the spatial dimensions of urban foodscapes, gaining insights into the interconnectedness of feasting, market spaces, and broader spatial dynamics that shape the culinary landscapes of cities.

ID221: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGN. This course is designed as a must course for the second-year industrial design students. The course aims to make a survey of the development of design practice in production sector and the outline of the transformation of production system from the mid-18th century pre-industrialization period also focusing on the earlier craft production system, and the following industrialization period, then the development of industrial design during modernization period to today. Following the early periods, it is indispensable to focus on modernism and the modernist assumptions/understanding/teachings behind design and industrial design, so to make a survey of modern design and industrial design to identify/understand/reflect upon the theoretical underpinnings of modernism in the practical and theoretical aspects of design and industrial design. The main objective of the course is to develop a critical perspective on the historical transformation, concepts and significant issues related to the development of modern design and industrial design. Particularly, change, transition and transformation occupy the agenda of the course as formative concepts; for the social, cultural and economic domains have undergone a considerable transformation and change within the changing economic, social and production relations through the course of the 19th century industrial revolution and the following 20th century capitalist system. The early 20th century developments opened a niche for the emergence of “industrial design” as a recognized profession when it has become an indispensable part of industrial; later post-industrial, socio-technological and consumer culture in the West. Furthermore, this situation has been gradually becoming similar for Turkey. As a candidate industrial designer, to reflect upon these issues will eventually and hopefully help to place the role of oneself generally within the technological and consumer culture of today’s system of industrial, economic and social relations.
 
Covers the period from industrialization (from the mid 18th century toward the end of the 19th century) to the years between two world wars. Focuses on the developments which led to the emergence of industrial design as a separate profession by developing an overall perspective on concepts and prominent issues related to design and industrial design. Aims to enable students to understand the events, issues and concepts that are significant for the historical transformation of production, production relations and transformation of design. Aims to enable students to develop a critical perspective on the theoretical and professional aspects of design and industrial design.
