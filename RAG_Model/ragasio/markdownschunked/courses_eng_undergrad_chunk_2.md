ARCH447: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE. The course aims to introduce students to interdisciplinary thinking by encouraging them to critically analyze films in relation to concepts of space, place, and visuality. 
 
This course aims to familiarize students with the necessary tools to critically analyze and historically contextualize cinematic representations of space. With a global emphasis, we will consider the ways in which cinema defines, reconsiders, and reshapes the notions of place. We will explore various approaches to cinematic space by studying a wide array of themes, concepts, and theories while also considering what happens to viewers sense of space and place in different media environments. The topics of the course will include domesticity, borders and movement, screening space and spectatorship, cine-museology, national and transnational spaces, animated worldmaking, and digital realisms. While the focus of the class will be on historical, social, and cultural distinctions in relation to the spatial representations on screen, we will also pay precise attention to formal and stylistic techniques as well as to the narrative and non-narrative organization of films we analyze.

ARCH491: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE. ARCH 491 “Landscape Research I” course aims to develop a general appreciation and knowledge on landscape issues by introducing increasing interaction of landscape design with urbanism, architecture, and art.  The course intends to reveal landscape as a natural, cultural, and aesthetic phenomenon; not only as a technical issue.  By examining a range of precedent projects in different contexts and scales, the course will discuss the extended field of landscape architecture to inspire students from architecture, urban planning, and design disciplines who intend further specialization in the area of landscape architecture and design.
The course is composed of a series of lectures and a research period.  Lecture series are assembled under two headings: On “Landscape” and Expanded Field of “Landscape”.  On “Landscape”, the first module of the course elaborates the meaning, language, and milieu of the landscape on a conceptual basis. This part ends with students' presentation on a selected article from the assigned reading list on the landscape.  The second module, Expanded Field of “Landscape”, discusses the inspiring and generative interplay between landscape and art, architecture, urbanism. The knowledge gained from both modules will be reflected through a landscape excursion required to be documented through a critical narration.
 
The main aim of this course is to present a general layout of landscape architecture. Besides, the methodology of planning of urban areas, national parks, recreation centers, sport areas, highways, are the usual subjects of this course.

ARCH492: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE. In the past two decades, the subject of landscape went under a fertile interrogation within design culture. This laid the latent capacity of the field to embrace a wide array of issues of the urban milieu bare. Among these, the field’s promise in addressing matters of infrastructure is remarkable. This is a radical challenge into infrastructure’s earlier preconception as a closed subject matter of engineering. Such a confrontation opens the round table for discussions around the nature of contemporary urbanization which renders systems of production and those of consumption remote. Injecting into this ground, this course dwells on systems of food – patterns of production, distribution, consumption and disposal. Touching upon issues ranging from gastronomic traditions to emergent food cultures, from (bio)politics to health, it aims to picture the breadth of the issue making room for (your) in-depth scrutiny into specific spatially momentous dimensions of the theme. 
 
The course is composed of a series of lectures and research period. Lecture series are assembled under two headings: On Landscape and Expanded Field of Landscape. First module of the course, On Landscape, elaborates the meaning, language and milieu of landscape on a conceptual basis. This part ends up with students presentation on a selected article from the assigned reading list on landscape.

CRP201: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF CITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING. The aim of the CRP 201 Planning Studio is to give tudent the ability to create relationship between function and structure, and establish the material basis of a sustainable socio-ecological development model. This encompasses: 
- production of the structure (program, relationships, usage, with sustainability criteria)
- establishing the relationship between structures (spatial proximity, accesibility, transportation, privacy)
- bringing together different functional systems (urban design project with model)
 
The planning studio course is structured to give students a comprehensive understanding of the part-whole relationship through induction. To achieve this, students are expected to develop the relationship between form and function through
?_x0001_Creating a structure, incorporating a specific program and integration within the parcel;
?_x0001_Establishing the relationship between structures, considering factors such as spatial proximity, accessibility, transportation, and privacy;
?_x0001_Integrating different structural systems, involving an urban design project at a 1/2000 scale along with a model at a 1/500 scale.
By the end of the course, students will have a thorough understanding of the complex relationships within a small part öf the city, starting from a single functional structure and expanding to a network of structures interacting through varied functions. The understanding of scale relationships will evolve from concrete to abstract, setting the groundwork for Planning Studio IV. As a sub task the 5tudio aims to establish the basis of a sustainable socio-ecological development model, Each analysis and design stage is enriched by the sustainability perspective to contribute to the production of sustainable urban structures from parts to whole.

CRP202: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF CITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING. Following our commitment to reach the whole through parts the studio is following the principles set in Planning Studio III. We are moving from neighbourhood to group of neighbourhoods and than to districts. 1/5000 scale can define this best as a starting point. When we advance further we start to cover  BatÄ±kent District with its relationship to urban macroform. We investigate inter urban, intra urban and urban rural relationships. 1/25.000 scale plan fits well to discover such relationships. At the final stage we will position BatÄ±eknt in a much wider context. While discussions will focus on reginal, national and international relationships their reflection on Ankara and BatÄ±kent will define our concentration point. We will utilise schematical represeentational techniques to respond requirements of spatial strategic plan. 
 
 
The planning studio course continues to explore part-whole relationship, extending from neighbourhood scale to the urban-regional scale, building upon the foundations set in Planning Studio III. It begins with the development of 1/5000 scale plans covering a broader part of the city. Students start to deal with a different abstraction level by moving from structures to land-uses. Central to the course is the interplay between land-uses and the transportation system that links them, Throughout the planning process, decisions are made based on policies and are realized through spatial strategies and implementation opportunities, Students will learn to:
Develop decisions based on relationship with different land-uses;
Utilise varying abstraction levels appropriate to each scale;
Conduct spatial analysis using written and numerical data;
Formulate visions, policies, strategies, and targets, and spatially represent them on urban development plans.
