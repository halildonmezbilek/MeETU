FLE134: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION. The course covers some basic and more advanced points of English grammar from the linguistic perspective, with a special emphasis on understanding the variation in meaning brought about by different grammatical structures. The students will be presented with examples of a variety of grammatical structures from a linguistic perspective. The students will be instructed to identify them and produce justifications for why a particular structure is used in a particular context. Whenever appropriate, emphasis will be placed on fine nuances in meaning that come about due to differences in the language use. After internalizing/reviewing a particular grammatical structure, students will be required to use it in new contexts. When appropriate, the course will also cover some basic points in the prosody of English, ranging from the pronunciation of problematic words/sounds, to the issues of intonation within and across sentences.
 
This course is a continuation of Contextual Grammar I. This course leads students to have a critical perspective into the advanced level structures (e.g. word classes, elements of the sentence, types of sentence, sentence fragments etc.) of different types of texts on a contextual level. Building upon analysis and synthesis, students evaluate the most problematic forms of English grammar with guidance in their function and usage using methods such as error analysis or discourse analysis. Besides presenting a descriptive review of the forms and function of advanced English grammar structure, this course encourages students to develop a critical stance toward the use of these structures in various contexts. The course also emphasizes interactive activities such as group and pair work.
