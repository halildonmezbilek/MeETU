FLE379: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION. This course is an introductory course to cognitive linguistics. Cognitive Linguistics is the study of the mind through language and the study of language as a cognitive function. Cognitive Linguistics has the goals to study how cognitive mechanisms like memory, attention and the representation of the language(s) in the mind are used during language behavior. Research in Cognitive Linguistics is multi-disciplinary; evidence is drawn from text analysis, language acquisition, language change, psycholinguistic experimentation, and brain imaging, among other sources. The purpose of this course is to provide a general orientation in Cognitive Linguistics, an understanding of its central themes and assumptions, and exposure to its empirical methods.We will discuss main issues in cognitive linguistics and some of the many connections that exist between linguistics and human cognition. The goal of this course is to lead students to a cognitive approach to the study of language and to the exploration of the relationship between linguistic structure, thought and the nature of embodied human experience. The following issues are the topics to be discussed: Language, Language and the Brain, Language Acquisition, the Mental Lexicon, the Representation of Language in the Mind
 
Models for the acquisition, processing, and application of human knowledge as the object of cognitive sciences. Cognitive linguistics as the investigation of the acquisition, processing, and application of language knowledge. Grammar as a model of human language knowledge. Relations to artificial intelligence.
