FLE136: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION. This course is a continuation of Advanced Reading and Writing I. This course aims to promote higher level thinking skills. By processing a variety of different authentic reading texts, students will develop superior-level sub-skills of reading, namely, making inferences and deductions, and reading between the lines. Students will relate inferences from the text to real life, and gain insights into the cultural similarities and differences. By means of the awareness gained from the texts, students will analyze, synthesize and evaluate information, and therefore react to readings. Students will also analyze and produce different types of essays (e.g. comparison and contrast, classification, cause-and-effect analysis, argumentative) that are unified, coherent and organized. In addition to the integration of reading with writing, students will develop basic research skills including library/internet search, and basic research report writing skills such as citing, paraphrasing and referencing.
