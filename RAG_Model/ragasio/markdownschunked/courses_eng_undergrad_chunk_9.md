PSY399: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY. The aim of this course is twofold: To acquaint the students with experimental research and to offer them an opportunity to gain hands-on experience and needed skills in experimental design. Throughout the semester students will conduct a replication study on a given topic in cognitive psychology. Ideally, the end result of this class, i.e. a research article, will be presented at a conference.
 
The major aim is to involve the students in a  typical research activity in their field of interest including designing of research, data collection, analysis of the results, and writing  up  a  research  report.  Areas in which workshops will be offered will be announced, together with the course codes, each semester.

PHIL404: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. The question of what constitutes sovereignty—the right to (legitimately) rule or govern oneself and/or another—has of late been called into question. What ish my nation? Ish a villain, and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal? What ish my nation? Who talks of my nation?—Shakespeare, Henry V
 
Who or what rules over or governs whom or what? How does this rule or governance operate? Why does it operate in one way and not another? Does it operate in only one way? By what logic, what power, what logical power, or what powerful logic does it operate, if it indeed operates at all? What are its limits, if any? Who determines those limits, if they exist? Who benefits from those limits as determined in a particular fashion? What allows the beneficiaries to benefit and others not to benefit, if that occurs? Should the number of the beneficiaries of the limits of sovereignty themselves be limited? If the limitation of sovereignty necessarily limits its beneficiaries, should sovereignty be limited? Is the limitation of sovereignty necessarily linked to limited beneficiaries? And so on.
            Our goal in this class, then, is to begin to get a handle on what is at stake in this current discussion of sovereignty and to come to grips with whether we can answer any of Captain Macmorris’s (admittedly decontextualized) questions from Henry V with assurance. We will pursue this goal through four texts at the forefront of this discussion.
 
Problems in the philosophy of social science and in political philosophy.

Email: mbeni@metu.edu.tr
Office hours:
Time and venue: Wednesdays 10.40-13.40 (hybrid)
 
Course description: 
The course introduces and explores the main issues of the philosophy of mind including the following ones: what is the mind, and how it is related to the body and the world? Can there be mindfulness independently of bodily modes? Can computers think? How does the mind represent the external world? Can connectionist networks embed representations? What is consciousness? The course considers some of the significant philosophical replies to those questions. It is organized into three main parts. The first part is concerned with the nature of mind and its relationship with the body. The second part focuses on the questions of how to model mind and how to account for its representational capacities (if any). The third part overviews discussions of intentionality, consciousness, and selfhood.
Upon successful completion of the course, the students will acquire the requisite skills to understand some of the main discussions of the field and articulate arguments for and against different positions and examine them critically.
 
The course outcome: 
To develop the skill to read and write about topics presented in the course and similar topics. To understand and critically discuss the basic metaphysical and epistemological views on the nature of the mind and its relationship with the body. To be able to see the relation between epistemological and metaphysical views on the one hand and some fundamental theories of the cognitive sciences and computer science on the other. To be able to reconstruct and critically evaluate the main replies to the questions about the nature of the mind and its relationship with the world.

PHIL411: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. No objective 
This course examines the philosophies of the three leading thinkers of the 17th century: Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz. The emphasis is on the central theses associated with rationalism: (i) that at least some of our concepts are not gained from experience but are innate; and (ii) that reason alone can provide us with knowledge of the external world through `intuition` of self-evident propositions and through `deduction` from those propositions. Selections from the most important works of these philosopherswill be read. Epistemological, metaphysical, ontological, and ethical issues of the Continental Rationalism will be investigated with reference to these central theses. Relations between Continental Rationalism and British Empiricism will be brought into view.

PHIL414: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. No objective 
There has been a great deal of speculation recently on how the evolution of language may explain the dramatic cognitive changes which occurred during the Upper Paleolithic resulting in the emergence of religion, art, long-distance trade, elaborate burial rituals, and complex social structures. Philosophy of language and philosophy of cognition are relevant to understanding the evolution of language and hence to understanding these cognitive changes. The course explores some of these connections.

PHIL421: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Intensive study of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason; the problem of metaphysics and the self-criticism of reason; Kant’s Copernican turn; the constitutive role of concepts in knowledge; the possibility of synthetic a priori knowledge; the cognitive faculties of the human mind; Kant’s theory of representation; the questions of the ends, the limits and the vocation of human reason.
Our text will be the Critique of Pure Reason. The central theme of the course will be Kant’s criticism of metaphysics which finds its formulation in “transcendental idealism”.  This theme obviously extends to the question of the ends, the limits and the vocation of human reason.
The aim of the course is to provide a way of entrance to Kant’s system of Critiques, which is highly influential and significant for the history of philosophy.
At the end of this course the students will learn:
*Kant's critical philosophy
*Basic concepts of the Kantian theoretical philosophy
 
 
This course will be concerned with Immanuel Kant`s most famous and influential work Critique of Pure Reason. After a brief introduction to Kant`s philosophy and its relation to empiricist and rationalist philosophies, we will pay particular attention to Kant`s conception of `critique`. We will trace how Kant explores the possibility of a priori knowledge and of transcendental subjectivity. Finally, we will discuss the problem of the unity of reason, i.e., the unity of reason in its theoretical and practical employment. In this respect, we will bring the first Critique into dialogue with the second Critique.

This course will be concerned with G.W.F. Hegel`s most famous and influential work Phenomenology of Spirit. After a brief introduction to Hegel`s philosophy and its relation to Kantian philosophy, we will pay particular attention to Hegel`s conception of `phenomenological method`. We will trace how Hegel explores the development of consciousness from its most ordinary form as `spirit`. Finally, we will bring Hegel`s thought into dialogue with contemporary continental philosophies.

Nietzsche's critique of Western traditional metaphysics and morality
Nietzsche's relation to Kant and Schopenhauer
academic reading and writing skills
 
Kants analysis of the principles underlying morality leads him to the statement of the categorical imperative, an idea that has been tremendously influential in the history of moral philosophy, yet also widely misunderstood. In this course we will first of all study the various formulations of the categorical imperative in Kants Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals. But in order to be able to assess the status of Kants moral philosophy in the history of philosophy, we will also look at a number of influential figures who  in their different ways  can be seen to have gone beyond Kant in their understanding of the role, status and functioning of morality.

PHIL433: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. David Hilbert, a 20th century logician, famously said: “The infinite! No other question has ever moved so profoundly the spirit of man; no other idea has so fruitfully stimulated his intellect; yet no other concept stands in greater need of clarification….” As pointed out by Hilbert, the concept of infinity has been an important topic in philosophy since the time of early Greek philosophers. In addition to its philosophical importance, it also has significant mathematical aspects. For example, the concept forms the basis of some counter-intuitive mathematical results, such as being able to paint an infinite surface with a finite amount of paint. Thus, a thorough investigation of the concept of infinity will need to have both a philosophical dimension and a mathematical/logical dimension. This proposed course aims to provide such an investigation. The investigation will be carried out in three overlapping dimensions: historical, metaphysical, and mathematical. In the first dimension, the development of the concept of infinity will be traversed, starting from early Greek thought and ending with 20th century views on infinity. The main focus of the metaphysical dimension of the course will be the distinction between potential infinity and actual infinity. The arguments for and against the existence of actual infinity will be thoroughly examined. In addition to these arguments, the metaphysical dimension of the course will also include an analysis of human finitude and the possibility of infinite beings. The mathematical dimension will cover early paradoxes of motion and time, Galileo’s “paradox”, Torricelli’s trumpet, Cantor’s transfinite mathematics, and some theorems relevant to the discussion of infinity.

PHIL461: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Course Description:  The main subject matter of this course will be the concept or phenomenon of death where we will be reading and evaluating principally contemporary literature.
In the first half of the course we will discuss inter alia the following: our conception of the human soul; the onto-epistemology of death; common conception of death as being “mysterious”; death and literature (the case of Elias Canetti); the contemporary approach to aging and dying in our culture; characterization of life as fabulae; and the existential-hermeneutic philosophy (specifically, Martin Heidegger’s view) regarding death as the ultimate phenomenological limit.
In the second half of the course we will focus chiefly on the notion of “harm due to dying”.  We will start with a classical view presented by Epicurus (4th cent. B.C.E.) and study the contemporary reaction the his “harm argument”.  We will also briefly discuss the Ancient and Spinozistic approaches to death.  Another major issue we will talk about will be the concept of immortality.  We will examine the notion of immortality, and then consider the pertinent analyses and philosophically evaluate its desirability.
Reading material:  A course package will be available at DereaÄzÄ± Fotokopi Ciltevi.  The reader contains selected articles from the following books:

PSY463: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY. This course is designed to present a general overview to the field of cultural and cross-cultural psychology and introduce you to the idea of cultural variation in human behavior. In doing this it examines only a small selection of the theoretical, empirical and applied issues of human behavior across cultures.
The rationale behind this course is that what may hold true in many contemporary, Western European and North American societies is not necessarily the norm in other societies. In order to better understand these differences, we will examine psychological constructs and theories through relativist and universalist perspectives, sometimes referred to as cultural psychology and cross-cultural psychology, respectively. This examination will seek to compare and contrast what is universal in human behavior and what is shaped and interpreted by cultural variations.
