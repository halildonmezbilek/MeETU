## Entry 1801

CE446: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING. Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. lt literally forms the basis of modern society. There is scarcely any aspect of daily life which does not depend directly or indirectly on concrete. Therefore, the properties of this material need to be known very well. In order to know and realize the importance of properties and the behavior of concrete, the properties of the materials that compose the concrete need to be known as well. The CE students of METU meet with cement and aggregate to a certain extent in their second year course, CE 244 Materials of construction, which includes many other construction materials such as metals, wood, clay products, building stones, lime, gypsum, etc. Due to the time limitation, such aspects as quality of mixing water and the types of admixtures used for concrete are not taught in CE 344. There is no other course for the CE students related to the concrete making materials during their BS program. During their brief study of cement and aggregate in the second year, the students usually do not realize the importance of these materials and they graduate without any further knowledge of their characteristics. Therefore, this course on “Concrete-Making Materials” is planned to furnish the fourth year students the necessary information on cements, aggregates, water and admixtures. Those students who will have the opportunity to take such a course will not only learn these materials but also properly to evaluate their importance from the technical and economic viewpoints.
 
Properties of fresh concrete: Workability, consistency, bleeding, stiffening, setting, air-entrainment, unit weight, uniformity, batching, mixing, conveying, placing, compaction and curing. Properties of hardened concrete: Nature and significance of concrete strength, kinds of strength, compressive strength, tensile strength, fatigue strength; durability, shrinkage and volume changes.

## Entry 1802

CE447: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING. All civil engineers are concerned with the structural safety, serviceability and the economics of the constructions with which they are involved. The successful approach to the problem can only be established through a sound knowledge of computational methods of engineering and a thorough understanding of the properties and behavior of engineering materials. Without a proper knowledge of materials neither the structural safety and serviceability nor the economics can be achieved in civil engineering projects. Two compulsory courses on materials are given to the second year civil engineering students. (CE 241- Materials Science and CE 344-Materials of Construction). However, since there is a vast variety of construction materials, appropriate and detailed information for all the important materials cannot be included in the regular contents of the above two courses. The CE 447 - Advanced Materials of Construction course intends to include subjects such as properties of alloy steels, structural steel products, precast concrete blocks, brick, tile, wood products, polymers and adhesives that are vitally important in civil engineering but cannot be covered in the CE 344 - Materials of Construction course.
