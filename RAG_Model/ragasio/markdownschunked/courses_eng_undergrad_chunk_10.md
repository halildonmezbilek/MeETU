PSY470: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY. 1. Students will demonstrate mastery of basic principles of behavior modification
2. Students will demonstrate skill in using behavioral principles to analyze behavioral problems impacting on health and designing interventions to address those behavioral problems. Demonstrations requires the following:
a. Developing a case summary that provides information critical to behavioral analysis
b. Providing a thorough behavior analytic assessment of the target problem and collateral problems
c. Developing an intervention plan and methods of evaluating the intervention
d. Providing an adequate behavior analytic rationale for addressing target and collateral problems and method of evaluation
 
This course is constructed around a series of cases in which behavioral interventions are designed to improve health, prevent disease, or mitigate the effects of chronic health problems of individuals. After the instructor will give lectures on basic principles of behavioral modification, the students will be tested or their understanding of these principles by giving two exams. In order to teach how to prepare and present the cases, first the instructor will present asthma, chronic pain, bulimia and smoking cases, and then the students will present their cases. In each case, the health issue to be addressed will be considered in the context of the individuals overall repertoire and life circumstances. A behavioral analysis of the problem will be followed by the design of an intervention plan based on behavioral principles. Besides behavioral principles that can be used for the chosen medical disorder, students are expected to give medical, psychosocial and psychological information related to the disorder

PSY3201: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY. Biological psychology explores how biological factors—such as the structure and function of the nervous system (brain, neurochemicals, hormones...) and genetics—shape behavior and mental processes. The aim of this course is to introduce you to the biological (mainly neural) basis of behavior and mental processes. First, you will learn about the anatomy and function of the brain and its cells. You will also acclimate yourself to the theory and methods for investigating brain function and the influence of behavioral genetics. Various psychological processes will be discussed from a biological perspective, including attention, memory, language, and emotion. Lastly, you will learn about brain functioning in neurological, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders.
 
The physiological basis of behavior; study of sensory, neural and motor structures for sensory coding, hunger and thirst, sleep - waking cycle, communication emotion, learning, and psychosomatic disorders.

PSY3290: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY. This course is for a small group students who are interested in research in the lab, we do not have lectures. Instead, we meet weekly for presentations on the literature, experiment ideas, experimental design proposals, and (pilot) results. Accordingly, there are no exams. Students are expected to submit 3 progress reports (Week 6, Week 12, and during Finals). For the first progress report everyone in class is expected to have presented literature at least once and prepared an experiment idea/timeline. Second progress report is expected to include a presentation of the experiment design and pilot data. Final report can be a manuscript or a project proposal depending on the progress during the semester.
Taking initiative is key to success in the course. At the end of semester, ideally, the students will have learnt how to take responsibility for a research project, such as, coming up with applicable and fruitful research ideas, acquiring ethics approval, finding funding and participants, analysing & reporting the outcomes and meeting deadlines while doing all of these.
Prerequisite: Consent of the instructor. 3rd year students can email the instructor with following information:
1. Which courses have you taken in Experimetal Psychology track? (Instructor and semester grade info)
2. What do you want to research? What subject are you curios about? (Make sure it is realistic and related to the research in the lab; we are not equipped to do EEG on bees, nor to research depth perception in praying mantis. 50 words max)

PSY3402: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY. This course is designed to present a general overview to the field of cultural and cross-cultural psychology and introduce you to the idea of
cultural variation in human behavior. In doing this it examines only a small selection of the theoretical, empirical and applied issues of
human behavior across cultures.
The rationale behind this course is that what may hold true in many contemporary, Western European and North American societies is not
necessarily the norm in other societies. In order to better understand these differences, we will examine psychological constructs and theories
through relativist and universalist perspectives, sometimes referred to as cultural psychology and cross-cultural psychology, respectively.
This examination will seek to compare and contrast what is universal in human behavior and what is shaped and interpreted by cultural
variations.
 
A general overview to the field of cultural and cross-cultural psychology that aims to examine a selection of the theoretical, empirical and applied issues of human behavior across cultures.
