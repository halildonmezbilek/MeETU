## Entry 509

BIOL351: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY. By the end of the course, the student will have learned:
- the fundamentals of transmission genetics, and the molecular, developmental and evolutionary mechanisms behind these;
- the basic processes in molecular genetics; including the structure of DNA, mechanisms of DNA replication, transcription, translation, and gene expression regulation;
- current problems, terminology, and technology in the field of genetics.
 
This course provides the students with the basic concepts of classical genetics and with the view of molecular genetics from today`s perspective. General principles of Mendelian Genetics, chromosome theory of inheritance, linkage and mapping, structure and function of genes, gene expression and its regulation, chromosomal aberrations and mutations are covered. Elementary principles that govern developmental, quantitative, behavioral, population and evolutionary genetics are also discussed.
