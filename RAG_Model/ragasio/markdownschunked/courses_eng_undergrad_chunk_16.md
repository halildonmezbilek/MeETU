IR422: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. The first part of the course deals with the basics, which includes an engagement with the foundational concepts of the IR discipline as well as the concept of “theory” itself. In the second part of the course, we discuss the major paradigms –a concept you will become familiar with in this course– of IR. Paradigms for our purposes refer to the totality of assumptions, thought patterns, theories, research questions, methods, and programs pertaining to a collectively imagined framing of the social world. Part III examines the important omissions. Many of the major paradigms proceed from a structural understanding of world politics that focus on the interactions of states. They tend not to engage with deeper issues of world politics such as its main constituent actors like the state. We need to grapple with the nexus of system and unit-level phenomena by situating the state historically and among major IR theories. Next, we assess the state of knowledge production the discipline, focusing not only on the relative neglect of non-Western approaches to IR but also by problematizing the omission of gender as a significant factor in world politics. We will end the course by discussing the future of the international order via an appraisal/critique of contemporary U.S. foreign policy. At this point, students will be well placed to excel in their final take-home exam. The final, Part IV, looks at contemporary, critical and emancipatory aspects of IR Theory by scrutinizing the constituent elements of the social world and the power dynamics therein. It asks students to think about what other kinds of hierarchies exist in the social world.
 
 
This course offers a systematic and comprehensive survey of contending classical and contemporary, traditional and behavioral theories of international relations.

The module is designed to provide an insight to European welfare and social policy, and identity the main patterns that led to its creation and evolution after the Second World War. The first part (6 weeks) focuses on the interplay between national social policy and welfare politics. After defining social policy and the notion of welfare, it goes on to analyze the link between social welfare and the ‘models of capitalism’ literature. It thus examines the principles underpinning the Continental, Anglo-Saxon, Southern Nordic and East European social policy regimes.

IR433: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. At the end of this course, the student is to learn

the basic concepts of international interventions with which the student can explain the underlying causes, dynamics, forms and consequences of international interventions
to equip the student with contextual and theoretical perspectives with which the student can undertake his/her research on international interventions.

 
The international interventions in the 19th and 20th centuries are examined to show the formation and redefinition of hegemonic projects as well as emergence of counter-hegemonic projects. This is to provide a better ground to discern continuity and change of the discourses and rhetoric of international interventions from 19th century to today. The international interventions since the end of the Cold War are to be examined taking the following cases samples: Iraq (1990), Bosnia-Herzegovina(OHR), Somalia (UNOSOM), Kosovo (UNMIK), Afghanistan (ISAF), Liberia, Congo, Ethiopia/Eritrea, East Timor, Iraq (2003) and the likelihood. The unilateral and multilateral interventions as well as ´assertive multilateral´ interventions are to be specifically discussed with particular reference to different schools of thoughts.

One of the most pressing issues of the new millenium will be the management of limited freshwater resources in the world as they are becoming more and more scare. Since an important number of these resources in the Middle East are transboundary rivers, the complexity of the problem increased as it became an issue at the international level. As a result, water has become a strategic asset since the early 1990s. Against this background, the course is considered in mainly four parts with a view to elaborate on the causes of conflict as well as on the prospects for cooperation over transboundary water resources in the Middle East, where special attention will be paid to the situation in the Euphrates-Tigris river basin.

International relations is often understood as the study of politics premised on inter-governmental relations. Therefore, mainstream theoretical accounts tend to privilege interaction among states as the paramount, if not only or exclusive, site of thematization. As a result, the global context is reduced in mainstream treatments to security, diplomacy and aspects of inter-governmental association. This course, seeking to remedy this gap, probes into the trans-national, trans-local, inter-ethnic traces and bonds in the wider global context through an exploration of various themes in the disciplines other than IR.

This course examines the political developments between the French Revolution, 1789, and the Great War, 1918. During these two centuries the political scene of Europe was transformed drastically. The 19th century witnessed the destruction of the ancien regime which was under continuous pressure from the emerging capitalism and the bourgeoisie class. The age of revolution was followed by the rise of nationalism, which created a new European state system. The evolving political events, finally led to the WWI, which caused the collapse of three empires in Europe and to the expansion of the European nation state system. In this course, our purpose is to analyze the new cultural forms expressing these changes and the major economic dynamics that influenced this period.

ADM1324: This course belongs to department of POLITICAL SCIENCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. For most of human history, humans lived in small groups who hunted and gathered their food, but around 8,000 B.C., things changed. Humans developed agriculture, settled in urban communities and eventually built huge empires, created religious institutions and explored the planet. In many areas of life, civilization brought about striking improvements and innovations. On the other hand, oppression, exploitation, and massive human suffering accompanied civilizations.
 
The goal of this course is to provide you with a foundation for understanding the world in which we live, keeping in mind humanity’s accomplishments as well as failures. Learning about history is not just memorizing a sequence of events, or a bunch of facts and dates; the point is to critically examine continuity and change over time. The large scope of this course will encourage more synthesis of ideas and integration of knowledge than thorough information on particular topics.
 
The course is arranged so as to avoid two common pitfalls of teaching and learning about civilizations. First, it will be stressed that the global dominance of Europe is a phenomenon that occurred only after c. 1500 and it is a mistake to project it backwards and read the whole world history from the perspective of European hegemony.  Secondly, historians of civilizations usually tell the stories of glorious empires, states, armies, monuments, wars, treaties, great men, etc. and tend to ignore women, the poor, peasants, slaves, and so on. In this course, we will put special emphasis on how important historical developments influenced those social groups who have traditionally been written off of history.
