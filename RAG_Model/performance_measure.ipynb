You're experiencing some trouble setting up a remote desktop connection to access your computer on the Middle East Technical University (METU) campus from outside. Don't worry, I'm here to guide you through the process.\\n\\nAs you mentioned, the default port 3389 is closed for security reasons, which is why you can't connect remotely. However, you can change the port number to establish a secure remote desktop connection.\\n\\nTo do this, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Access the Registry Editor**: Press the Windows key +\", 'response_time': 35.10369539260864, 'precision_at_1': 1, 'bert_score': 0.8469405174255371, 'rouge_l_score': 0.12807881773399016, 'id': 5, 'synthetic_question': 'Why cant I connect to my computer at METU remotely, and what steps should I take to resolve this issue?', 'ground_truth_answer': '\\n\\nIf you are having trouble setting up a remote desktop connection, it may be possible for two reasons.\\na) The port number used for the connection should be changed\\nb) There is a problem with the remote desktop connection settings or the username\\n\\na) The port number used for the connection should be changed\\nSome security measures has been taken about the port 3389 which is used for remote desktop connection to METU campus. Port 3389 keeps closed two-way (campus in and out) because of security reasons. In order to connect to your computer at METU from outside the campus using remote desktop connection, you should change the remote desktop port number for both of the computers. There are two ways to do so:\\nSelect Start > Run > regedit. On \"Registry Editor\" select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\\\ System \\\\ CurrentControlSet \\\\ Control \\\\ TerminalServer \\\\ WinStations \\\\ RDP-Tcp and change the \"PortNumber\" with any unused port number between 1025 and 65535.\\n\\nThen, you should give permission to this port number on Windows Firewall. For\\xa0Windows 7, select Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Firewall > Advanced Settings. For Windows 10, select Start > Windows Administrative Tools > Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.\\nFrom the menu on the left side, select Outbound Rules on the computer you are using remote desktop connection, Inbound Rules on the computer you are going to connect remotely. Then click New Rule on the right. If you are going to use both computers to be connected remotely, you should create both inbound and outbound rules on both computers.\\n\\n\\nOn \"New Outbound Rule Wizard\", select Port as the rule type and click Next. On the next screen choose the protocol as TCP and write down the port number you have defined.\\n\\n\\nThen, select Allow the connection and click Next. Finally, specify a name for the rule and click Finish\\n\\n\\nIf you are using a firewall software other than Windows Firewall, you should give permissions to the port number on that software.\\nTo activate the settings restart the computers. For using remote desktop connection, write down the computer name as IP:port number.\\n\\nb) There is a problem with the remote desktop connection settings or the username\\nThe username that should be entered for the remote desktop connection may not be the same as the username when computer is turned on. If you are having trouble making a remote desktop connection to your computer, it is necessary to check that the username. To do this, the you should start the Task Manager (press \"Ctrl + Alt + Delete\" and choose \"Start Task Manager\" or press right click on the taskbar and choose \"Start Task Manager\") and check the username on the \"Users\" tab.\\n\\n\\nBy establishing a remote connection you should use this username.\\n\\nIf there is a version difference with the remote desktop connection provided between the two computers (eg, trying to connect a Windows 7 computer from a Windows XP computer), you should choose \"Allow connections from computers running any version of Remote Desktop (less secure)\" from the remote desktop connection settings. You could access these settings from \"Remote\" tab in the \"System Properties\".\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n', 'link': 'https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/i-cannot-make-remote-desktop-connection-what-should-i-do'}\n"

After the dormitory manager completes the registration, users have to sign in with their central system user name and password at\\xa0https://netregister.metu.edu.tr\\nUsers can obtain access to the cable network after entering their MAC address information in Wired Network\\xa0menu in netregister.metu.edu.tr\\nUsers stay in the summer time dormitories should be sure about their dormitory registration made for right dormitory. To do this, they can consult their dormitory manager or Directorate of Dormitories (2nd dormitory building) to get information. If users are not registered to any dormitory or their registration was made to wrong dormitory, they won\\'t be able to make their own wired network registration on the netregister interface (https://netregister.metu.edu.tr/).\\nNote: Since DHCP is used (i.e. recognized automatically) in all dormitories, the users in the dormitories can connect to the internet after completing all the steps defined above. They do not have to enter TCP/IP settings. Moreover, users who stay in those dormitories can also reach\\xa0https://netregister.metu.edu.tr\\xa0through local cable network before registration in order to complete their registration.\\nSteps, in order to be connected to the internet after obtaining IP address information, are as follows:\\nBe sure that your computer recognizes your Ethernet card. You can find it by clicking right to the computer icon, choosing properties, then device manager and network card. If your computer recognizes Ethernet card, that is, the right software is installed, you can continue without any problem. If there is an exclamation mark on the device icon, that means your computer does not recognize the Ethernet card. Then, you have to install the right software.\\nNext step is the configuration of TCP/IP settings. Click right on the computer icon on the desktop, choose properties, then TCP/IP settings, and then choose properties. You can complete the settings by selecting \"Obtain automatically\" \\xa0in the relevant boxes and then clicking OK. Almost in all Windows operating systems, the configuration of TCP/IP settings is conducted similarly.\\nLastly, in order to connect to the cable network, it is necessary to obtain a UTP network cable from electronic stores. \\xa0You should measure the distance between the location of your computer and network plug. After connecting the UTP network cable to your computer and plug, you should be able to connect to METU cable network.\\nIt is suggested for the users who utilize network connection in the dormitory regions to read the Dormitory Rooms Computer Network Rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can visit https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/how-can-i-find-out-about-source-my-network-connection-failure-dormitories\\xa0if you have any problems connecting to the cable network.
