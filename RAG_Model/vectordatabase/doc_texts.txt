The Office of Dormitories, with the aim of solving our students' accommodation issues by offering a high standard service, obtained TSE-EN ISO 9001-2000 certificate of quality from the Turkish Standards Institution (TSE) in 2005. Regarding the quality of our dormitory services, the inspections carried out in 2021 in accordance with the TSE-EN ISO 9001:2015 standards were completed with success.
The services provided by our unit are carried out according to the procedures, instructions, duties, and responsibilities determined within the Dormitory Regulations, Student Discipline Regulations of the higher education institutions, decisions taken by the Executive Board of Dormitories, and the certificates of quality.
Therefore, every year, the Executive Board of Dormitories evaluates the dormitory applications of students based on the current capacity of dormitories, the number of applications, and the conditions for staying in the dormitories established in accordance with the aforementioned regulations and approved by the Rectorate. Then, the registration procedures of the students whose applications are accepted are conducted.
We endeavor to provide 24/7 uninterrupted service that includes an environment of respect, love, equality and trust in our dormitories with an understanding that prioritizes a service that is high-quality, transparent, modern but at the same time adherent to the traditions of METU, which can only be achieved with a team spirit.

Facilities in the Dormitories: There is a mini-fridge in each room. For each student, a studying desk, a chair, a closet for clothes, and a closet for shoes are provided in each room. In addition, the dormitory offers students a bedding set consisting of bed sheet, blanket and pillow. Students can also bring and use their own bedding sets if they prefer to do so (but in this case, washing and cleaning these bedding sets will be their responsibility). In our dormitories, there are common studying rooms, TV rooms, laundry rooms, and kitchens as well as another common room for students of the Department of Architecture so that they can carry out their activities such as drawing. A sufficient number of automatic washing machines, dryers, irons, and ironing boards are available to students in the laundry rooms.
The bedding sets in the room are changed periodically, but if need be, they can be changed outside their regular cycle as well. These bedding sets are washed and ironed in the laundry room, where industrial washing machines are used. There is hot water in our dormitories ready for use 24/7.

Transportation: There are buses and minibuses operating between the city center and the dormitories between the hours 07.00 and 24.00. Besides, there also are ring busses that operate between dormitories and departments.

Application for Dormitories: Students whose family resides outside of Ankara can apply for the dormitories. Students who start our university this year, if they want to stay in our dormitories, must fill out the dormitory-related sections on the YKS Registration Program website during their university registration process and thus complete their applications.

Evaluation of the Applications: The economic and social situation of each student's family who applies for dormitories is investigated through local administration units. This information obtained from the local authorities and the students' scores/rankings according to YKS are taken into consideration to create an overall score for each student in accordance with the criteria determined by the Executive Board of Dormitories and approved by the Rectorate. The results of applications are announced on the Office of Dormitories website. After learning their scores, students can learn when they can register for the dormitories and the dates for the next student placement through the announcement tables regarding registrations.
The students who have the following ranking success in YKS Exam are placed in the METU dormitories without further consideration of other criteria: ranking in the top 4,000 in Quantitative Field, ranking in the top 500 in Equal Weight Field, ranking in the top 300 in Verbal Field, and ranking in the top 100 in Foreign Language Field.
Registration for Dormitories: The placement of students to the dormitories are carried out according to their scores. Each week, considering how many rooms and beds remain vacant, new students with lower scores are placed. This placement process continues until all the students, who applied for the dormitories within the application dates, are listed. When a student is entitled to register for the dormitory, they are expected to gather all the required documents and submit them to the Office of Dormitories to complete the registration process.

The Right to Stay in the Dormitory: Your right to stay in the dormitory is calculated by adding one year to the rest of your regular education period.
Notice: The stay of those students will be rendered void, if they have no more rights to stay in the dorm.
The Status of The Students Who Did Not Register Within the Specified Dates: The student, who had the right to register to the dormitories according to the general points announced, but did not register within the specified deadlines, loses the right to register himself/herself with this general point announced for him/her on the list. In this case the students' points will be calculated again according to late application situation.

The Regulations in the Dorms: METU student dormitories are managed, run and controlled according to the rules in the Dormitory Regulations. The Dormitory Regulations can be read from bulletin boards of every dorm. We recommend our students to read these regulations.  Moreover, the written information about the regulations in the dorms is handed to the students during registrations to the dorms. 

Going on Leave

Every student has the right to go on a leave for 15 days within a semester other than the weekends and holidays. The students, who will use their leave, should fill out a form, which can be obtained from the dormitory office. The students below the age of 18 should bring a note of permission from their parents to be able to use their leaves. The related form can be obtained from the Directorates of the Dormitories.

Content:  Focusing on the major movements and artists of the post-war period, this course allows students to learn methods, tools, and terminologies to critically analyze contemporary art in relation to social and historical context, critical debates, new media, and the changing role of the spectator/participant. Not only does the art production postdating World War II raise the questions of what art is or can be, but it is also concerned with endless possible ways in which the audiences can experience art. Contemporary art employs a range of new materials and technologies, questions the validity of intentionality and authorship, and addresses previously excluded audiences. It invades non-art spaces, blurs the boundaries between text and image, document and performance, asks questions about institutional frames (the museum, gallery, and art journal), and generates new forms of criticism. Much of the canon of what counts as important is still in flux, especially for the last twenty years. And the stage is no longer centered only on the United States and Europe but is becoming increasingly global.

Course: ARCH491
Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE.
Objective: ARCH 491 “Landscape Research I” course aims to develop a general appreciation and knowledge on landscape issues by introducing increasing interaction of landscape design with urbanism, architecture, and art.  The course intends to reveal landscape as a natural, cultural, and aesthetic phenomenon; not only as a technical issue.  By examining a range of precedent projects in different contexts and scales, the course will discuss the extended field of landscape architecture to inspire students from architecture, urban planning, and design disciplines who intend further specialization in the area of landscape architecture and design. The course is composed of a series of lectures and a research period.  Lecture series are assembled under two headings: On “Landscape” and Expanded Field of “Landscape”.  On “Landscape”, the first module of the course elaborates the meaning, language, and milieu of the landscape on a conceptual basis. This part ends with students' presentation on a selected article from the assigned reading list on the landscape.  The second module, Expanded Field of “Landscape”, discusses the inspiring and generative interplay between landscape and art, architecture, urbanism. The knowledge gained from both modules will be reflected through a landscape excursion required to be documented through a critical narration. 
Content:  The main aim of this course is to present a general layout of landscape architecture. Besides, the methodology of planning of urban areas, national parks, recreation centers, sport areas, highways, are the usual subjects of this course. Erosion control, both living and non-living materials and their characteristics and standards are also presented. 
Course: ARCH492
Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE.
Objective: In the past two decades, the subject of landscape went under a fertile interrogation within design culture. This laid the latent capacity of the field to embrace a wide array of issues of the urban milieu bare. Among these, the field’s promise in addressing matters of infrastructure is remarkable. This is a radical challenge into infrastructure’s earlier preconception as a closed subject matter of engineering. Such a confrontation opens the round table for discussions around the nature of contemporary urbanization which renders systems of production and those of consumption remote. Injecting into this ground, this course dwells on systems of food – patterns of production, distribution, consumption and disposal. Touching upon issues ranging from gastronomic traditions to emergent food cultures, from (bio)politics to health, it aims to picture the breadth of the issue making room for (your) in-depth scrutiny into specific spatially momentous dimensions of the theme.

Objective: The aim of the CRP 201 Planning Studio is to give tudent the ability to create relationship between function and structure, and establish the material basis of a sustainable socio-ecological development model. This encompasses:  - production of the structure (program, relationships, usage, with sustainability criteria) - establishing the relationship between structures (spatial proximity, accesibility, transportation, privacy) - bringing together different functional systems (urban design project with model) 
Content:  The planning studio course is structured to give students a comprehensive understanding of the part-whole relationship through induction. To achieve this, students are expected to develop the relationship between form and function through ?	Creating a structure, incorporating a specific program and integration within the parcel; ?	Establishing the relationship between structures, considering factors such as spatial proximity, accessibility, transportation, and privacy; ?	Integrating different structural systems, involving an urban design project at a 1/2000 scale along with a model at a 1/500 scale. By the end of the course, students will have a thorough understanding of the complex relationships within a small part öf the city, starting from a single functional structure and expanding to a network of structures interacting through varied functions. The understanding of scale relationships will evolve from concrete to abstract, setting the groundwork for Planning Studio IV.

Content:  Food is our fuel for existence and the symbolic center of our lives. Food is not only a bare necessity, it is also the medium through which knowledge, tradition and even history are transmitted, known and shared by all. The concept of ?foodscapes? emerged in the 1990s within the context of studies of social and spatial inequalities in public health and food systems. Since then, it has incorporated the study of the entire chain of food from its production to consumption especially in the context of changing notions of landscape and space. This course intends to introduce the term 'foodscape' as a part of urban studies. The term and its connotations will be explored through various aspects of urban and rural life; it is not just a material space, but includes socio-political processes. The course aims to investigate how food shapes and is shaped by the spatial characteristics of urban and rural environments, considering the historical, cultural, and socio-economic factors that contribute to the diversity of food experiences in places. Different approaches, such as analytical, systematical, or phenomenological, will be explored to develop a holistic spatial approach to urban and rural foodscapes. Each week, examples from around the world will be presented around specific themes to enrich the understanding of general concepts. Throughout the course, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the spatial intricacies that define a city's culinary identity. The course encourages a critical examination of the role of food in shaping the urban experience whereby the students will critically analyze the spatial dimensions of urban foodscapes, gaining insights into the interconnectedness of feasting, market spaces, and broader spatial dynamics that shape the culinary landscapes of cities.

Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGN.
Objective: This course is designed as a must course for the second-year industrial design students. The course aims to make a survey of the development of design practice in production sector and the outline of the transformation of production system from the mid-18th century pre-industrialization period also focusing on the earlier craft production system, and the following industrialization period, then the development of industrial design during modernization period to today. Following the early periods, it is indispensable to focus on modernism and the modernist assumptions/understanding/teachings behind design and industrial design, so to make a survey of modern design and industrial design to identify/understand/reflect upon the theoretical underpinnings of modernism in the practical and theoretical aspects of design and industrial design. The main objective of the course is to develop a critical perspective on the historical transformation, concepts and significant issues related to the development of modern design and industrial design. Particularly, change, transition and transformation occupy the agenda of the course as formative concepts; for the social, cultural and economic domains have undergone a considerable transformation and change within the changing economic, social and production relations through the course of the 19th century industrial revolution and the following 20th century capitalist system. The early 20th century developments opened a niche for the emergence of “industrial design” as a recognized profession when it has become an indispensable part of industrial; later post-industrial, socio-technological and consumer culture in the West. Furthermore, this situation has been gradually becoming similar for Turkey. As a candidate industrial designer, to reflect upon these issues will eventually and hopefully help to place the role of oneself generally within the technological and consumer culture of today’s system of industrial, economic and social relations. 
Content:  Covers the period from industrialization (from the mid 18th century toward the end of the 19th century) to the years between two world wars. Focuses on the developments which led to the emergence of industrial design as a separate profession by developing an overall perspective on concepts and prominent issues related to design and industrial design. Aims to enable students to understand the events, issues and concepts that are significant for the historical transformation of production, production relations and transformation of design.

Objective: No objective
Content:  This course aims to introduce students to the most important concepts and problems of the main branches of philosophy from a systematical-rather than a historical- point of view. It starts with the question of what philosophy is. The answer to this question lies in finding a criterion by means of which philosophy can be differentiated from science and various other human activities. The rest of the course discusses the following basic topics. Validity of arguments (logic), the nature of truth and knowledge (epistemology), the fundamental categories of being (ontology), the meaning of linguistic expressions (philosophy of language), scientific concepts and theories (philosophy of science), the distinction between morally good and bad (ethics), and, finally beauty in nature and value of artworks (aesthetics).

Course: PHIL201
Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY.
Objective: This course offers an introductory survey to various ethical theories within the history of western philosophy, including virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, social contract theory, feminist ethics, and existentialist ethics. Bringing these ethical frameworks to bear on contemporary ethical issues, this course seeks to combine theoretical and applied approaches to ethics. Beginning with the question of “the good life,” we shall ask: Why live ethically? And how to live ethically? Tracing how each philosopher with whom we engage responds to these questions, the students are expected to develop an understanding of different kinds of ethical reasoning, which in turn would enable them to analyze issues and propose an informed, intelligent response. As their final project, the students will write a paper in which they take up a specific ethical problem (e.g. capital punishment, suicide, prostitution, torture, hunger strike, pornography, etc.) and argue for a position by utilizing and building on the kinds of ethical reasoning we traced and scrutinized throughout the semester. 
Content:  Problems of moral conduct. Theories of ethics. 
Course: PHIL202

Objective: A note about who can take the course:  This PHIL undergraduate course is open to Philosophy students only.  I am unable to admit non-Philosophy students during normal registration week.  If, however, some people drop the course in the following week, I may admit a few more students to the course.  If you want to be considered during the add-drop period, send me an e-mail before it explaining your background. COURSE DESCRIPTION:      "ΓΝΩΘΙ ΣΕΑΥΤΟΝ"      (Inscription at Apollo’s Temple at Delphi) This course is intended to be the second part of a general introduction to theory of knowledge. Although I will assume in my lectures a basic philosophical background and some familiarity with epistemological notions (as provided, for instance, by PHIL-106), the course can in principle be taken independently --i.e., without previously taking PHIL-106. In this course, we will cover some historical material as well as readings from contemporary epistemology literature.  The course will have three main philosophical/discursive axes: (1) Epistemology of Perception, (2) Theories of Justification, and finally (3) Feminist Epistemology.  In dealing with (2) above, emphasis will be placed especially on the debate between foundationalism and coherentism.  And we will study part (3) as an example of the contemporary reaction to traditional analytic epistemology. Grading:  Students will write two in-class examinations: (1) The mid-term exam will probably take place in April (40% grade value); (2) The remaining part of your total grade will come from the final exam (60% grade value).  Please note that if you take only one of those two exams, you will get an ‘F’ grade.

Objective: At the end of this course, students will have learned, some challenges to human morality (amoralism, theism, relativism) and how to deal with them, the basic concepts of metaethic (realism, subjectivism, intrinsic value), the fundamental theories of normative ethics (consequentialism, virtue ethics, deontological/Kantian ethics), the basic concepts of and problems in environmental ethics (speciesism, rights of animals, anthropocentrism, biocentrism, ecocentrism) 
Content:  Environmental ethics is a crucial as well as a controversial area of applied ethics that approaches normative issues and principles related with human intervention with the natural environment. It is crucial for the guidance of individuals, corporations, and governments in determining the principles affecting their policies, lifestyles, and actions across the entire range of environmental issues. It is controversial for the complexity of environment, conflict of interest in environment, and human centered ethical traditions, concepts and theories neglecting non-human environment. So while uncertainty and conflict of interest increase the demands on ethical principles, the basic assumptions of traditional ethics are difficult to extend to the non-human environment. Environmental ethics must also be a theoretical field of ethics to deal, for example, with the following problems. People have rights, but do other (higher) animals? Do plants even have interests? Can only individuals deserve to be subject for moral considerations or can group of individuals, such as species and ecosystem also? These and similar questions are treated by both anthropocentrists and ecocentrists.

Content:  This course is an inquiry into the role of emotion in a rational life. As an introductory course, it requires no pre-knowledge of philosophy. It tries to explore the role that emotion plays in the acquisition of  beliefs and desires, the relation between them, and their transformation into actions and policies. It studies also emotions considered as a component of life and experience and investigate whether they may themselves be subject to rational assessment. For this purpose it goes to the historical roots of the problem of emotions, e.g. what role does it play in our life? What is an emotion? These questions are important in the philosophy of mind and ethics. Philosophers have not always despised the importance of emotions. Hume, for example, claimed that reason is and ought to be, the slave of passion. Nietzsche, on the other hand, insisted that emotion and reason are not really opposite but complementary to each other. In this course, the claims of important philosophers are discussed and moral, aesthetic political implications of their view of emotion are criticized.

Content:  This course is an introduction to the philosophy of literature. The fundamental question discussed in this course is how philosophy, ordinary life and literature are related. How can we draw boundary line between philosophy and literature? How are literary works structured? With these questions the course addresses the philosophical question about the role of art in human life. The continuity of everyday life and the coherence of artistic literature are distinct though closely related. In ancient Greece, Literature was crucial for philosophy´ s own self definition. Subsequent philosophy of literature has been denoted to overcoming Plato´s condemnatory theory. The vast majorities of theories follow Plato in treating literature as a distinct domain, separate from and subordinate to philosophy. But since Romanticism, some have argued for the essential unity of these two enterprises. The course studies the relation between life, literature and philosophy within historical context as well as in contemporary culture.

Objective: COURSE DESCRIPTION: The Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection is one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the modern era. Although it is a theory of biology with its revolutionary consequences in all life sciences it has also had an enormous impact on science in general, philosophy, religion, and politics the last 150 years. In this course, some of the major concepts and problems of evolutionary biology, such as fitness, adaptation, the structure of the evolutionary theory, the problem of the units of selection, the species problem, are presented and examined from a philosophical perspective. COURSE OBJECTIVES: At the end of this course, the student will have learned: basic concepts about the evolutionary theory, such as natural selection, fitness, adaptation; basic philosophical problems related with the evolutionary theory, such as nature of biological laws/models, biological explanations, the creationism-evolution debate, the tautology problem, reduction, biological teleology, the units of selection problem, the problems about adaptationism, the species problem, biological determinism, evolution of morality and culture.

Objective: Generally speaking, medieval philosophy is taken to run from around the fifth through fifteenth centuries CE, roughly corresponding to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire through the beginning of the Renaissance, which itself is taken as running from the mid-fourteenth through mid-seventeenth centuries. These two periods, then, overlap. To the extent they can be genuinely teased apart, the medieval period is marked by adherence to monotheistic religious tenets and authority as well as to Aristotle, while the Renaissance sees the rediscovery of pre-Christian thought and a decreasing reliance on prior texts and thinkers. However, none of these qualifications can be taken as fully descriptive of either period and their similarities and differences will become apparent in equal measure as we move through the material. As this is a survey course covering approximately 1200 years of philosophy, it is impossible to do justice to either period, more so than in other survey courses. That said, we will read many of their most important thinkers. We begin with Augustine of Hippo (354-430) and his sermon on the sacking of Rome in 410. We then move to selections from the Roman senator Boethius (477-524); the great Islamic philosophers Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 980-1037) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes, 1126-1198); and the high watermarks of medieval Christian thought as found in Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) and John Duns Scotus (1265/6-1308). With that, we move into the Renaissance with readings from Nicholas of Cusa’s (1401-1464) On Learned Ignorance, Niccolò Machivelli’s (1469-1527) Prince, Martin Luther’s (1483-1546) “Ninety-five Theses,” the Coimbra Commentaries (1591-1606), and closing with Francisco Suárez’s (1548-1617) Metaphysical Disputations.

Objective: COURSE DESCRIPTION: The Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection is one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the modern era. Although it is a theory of biology with its revolutionary consequences in all life sciences it has also had an enormous impact on science, philosophy, religion, and politics for the last 150 years. In this course, as we examine the evolutionary thinking by the work of a number of key representative figures in the past and present we will also be questioning as to whether scientific theories, in general, and the evolutionary theory, in particular, are social constructions by searching for values inherent in scientific theories and research. COURSE OBJECTIVES: The aim of this course is to demonstrate students by concrete examples from the history of evolutionary biology that, although science involves social (nonscientific/epistemic) values both in discovering and testing scientific theories, it, nevertheless, progresses and achieves objective knowledge by removing these values from science. COURSE TOPICS: Problem of objectivity and subjectivity in science, epistemic (scientific) and non-epistemic (social) values in science, the role of metaphors in science.

Course: PHIL343
Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY.
Objective: Course intended mainly for 3rd and 4th year students in Philosophy. However, 2nd year students may get enrolled as well. Moreover, there may be a small room for students of other departments, who are seriously interested in the course.   Course Syllabus: This course contains a substantial reading component. The purpose of this course is to improve students’ reading skills needed for philosophy as well as to discuss what philosophical activity is all about by studying Plato’s dialogue the Meno, and by doing so we shall study Plato’s philosophy and shed some light on what he might understand this activity.   This course firstly aims at introducing you to the practice of reading in philosophy by studying thoroughly a text in the Western philosophical tradition. Students will also get to grasp some problems that have been significant to philosophy from its beginnings, the major one of which is the problem of knowledge. In the process of thoroughly studying the text and the arguments appearing in the text, you will develop your own philosophical and analytical skills.   As for Plato’s philosophy and his understanding of what this activity entails, the course will also include instruction in finding and defining problems, formulating questions to capture the problems defined, arrangement, developing arguments, revision, and strategies of research.   
Content:  The course will be concerned with the selected dialogues of Plato. After a brief introduction to Plato`s conception of Socratic 2410osophizing (in Apology, Crito, Euthyphro) we will trace the development of Plato`s ethical theory from the Socratic ethics of the Protagoras to the Platonic ethics of the Republic; and Plato`s metaphysical theory from the Meno and Phaedo to the Republic and Timaeus. Finally, some attention will be given to his theory of knowledge in the later dialogues, especially the Theaetetus, the Parmenides, and the Sophist. 
Course: PHIL344
Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY.
Objective: This semester (2021-2022 Fall), the main objective will be to cover a number of Aristotelian subjects, especially concerning his theory of being and theory of mind. The main objective will be to familiarize students with Aristotle's concepts of truth (aletheia) and intellect (nous). Please also note that in line with the partial normalization process, the classes this term (2021-2022 Fall) will be hybrid: they will be held both in person and also online on Zoom. 
Content:  The course will be concerned with Aristotle`s most famous and influential work Metaphysics. After a brief introduction to Aristotle`s philosophy and its place in the history of ancient philosophy, we will pay particular attention to Aristotle`s conception of `first philosophy` as the most valuable and comprehensive of all sciences, the so-called `metaphysics`. We will trace how Aristotle explores the science that is devoted to the investigation of first causes, of Being as  such and of the form of knowledge that deserves the title `wisdom`. Finally, we will consider Aristotle`s formulation of the fundamental metaphysical problems: the questions concerning the substance, the particular and the universal, form and matter, potentiality and actuality, and finally, the mover and the moved.

Course: PHIL390
Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY.
Objective: Some of the central philosophical problems of science highlighted by the success, methods and social settings of modern science. Topics and problems to be covered throughout the course will be selected from the following list –not all topics may be covered in any one semester: * What is special about the scientific method? What constitutes a scientific approach to investigating the world? Why be scientific? Science vs. pseudo-science or good vs. bad science. * Does science make inductive assumptions? Does it simply generalise from the cases already investigated? If so, how are such inductive assumptions to be justified? * Can evidence ever establish scientific theories? If not, what exact role does empirical testing play in science? The role of experiment in the scientific method; the Duhem-Quine Problem; the empirical basis of science; weight of evidence and predictive success. * Are there any special problems concerned with testing statistical or probabilistic theories? * Scientific explanation; what are ad hoc explanations and moves? Why should they be avoided in science? * What is the status of presently accepted scientific theories? The problem of theory-choice (or theory-change) and scientific rationality. What are revolutionary-theory-changes in science? How do revolutionary-theory-changes in science affect the view that science consists of a body of established truths? And how does the phenomenon of revolutionary changes in science affect traditional notions of scientific rationality? Do scientific revolutions involve changes in scientific methodology? 
Content:  Historical and epistemological evaluation of some rationality theories, e.g., Popper`s Falsificationism, Kuhn`s Scientific Revolutions, Feyerabend`s Liberalism, Lakatos`s MSRP and Structural Realism.

Course: PHIL392
Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY.
Objective: Course Intended for students of Philosophy and other Departments.   Course Syllabus: This course, while providing a philosophical and historical account of how non-Euclidean geometries were discovered, deals with some important methodological and historical problems of geometry such as the possibility of methodology of non-empirical sciences, continuity and progress in geometry with special emphasis on case studies in geometry.   Course Content: The discovery of non-Euclidean geometries has a long and complicated history. The predominant account of this discovery claims that this history is a linear compilation of geometrical results and should be best understood as a sequence of foundational studies. Moreover, it does not deal with the issues of rationality geometrical progress and revolutions in the history of geometry. So it has some weakness to represent faithfully what went on when such a discovery came about. An historical-cum-methodological account of this discovery shall be offered in terms of methods employed by geometers in problem-solving, the characterization of geometrical language, problems and theories, and the intentions of geometers themselves. Euclid’s and Saccheri’s works will be studied as case studies.   Pre-Requisites: Some familiarity with logic and the philosophy and history of science.   Written Work, Oral Presentation and Examination: tba.     
Content:  History of the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries; historical and methodological problems of geometrical progress.

Objective: The question of what constitutes sovereignty—the right to (legitimately) rule or govern oneself and/or another—has of late been called into question. What ish my nation? Ish a villain, and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal? What ish my nation? Who talks of my nation?—Shakespeare, Henry V   Who or what rules over or governs whom or what? How does this rule or governance operate? Why does it operate in one way and not another? Does it operate in only one way? By what logic, what power, what logical power, or what powerful logic does it operate, if it indeed operates at all? What are its limits, if any? Who determines those limits, if they exist? Who benefits from those limits as determined in a particular fashion? What allows the beneficiaries to benefit and others not to benefit, if that occurs? Should the number of the beneficiaries of the limits of sovereignty themselves be limited? If the limitation of sovereignty necessarily limits its beneficiaries, should sovereignty be limited? Is the limitation of sovereignty necessarily linked to limited beneficiaries? And so on.             Our goal in this class, then, is to begin to get a handle on what is at stake in this current discussion of sovereignty and to come to grips with whether we can answer any of Captain Macmorris’s (admittedly decontextualized) questions from Henry V with assurance. We will pursue this goal through four texts at the forefront of this discussion.

Objective: PHIL407. PHILOSOPHY OF MIND I  Lecturer: Majid D. Beni Email: mbeni@metu.edu.tr Office hours: Time and venue: Wednesdays 10.40-13.40 (hybrid)   Course description:  The course introduces and explores the main issues of the philosophy of mind including the following ones: what is the mind, and how it is related to the body and the world? Can there be mindfulness independently of bodily modes? Can computers think? How does the mind represent the external world? Can connectionist networks embed representations? What is consciousness? The course considers some of the significant philosophical replies to those questions. It is organized into three main parts. The first part is concerned with the nature of mind and its relationship with the body. The second part focuses on the questions of how to model mind and how to account for its representational capacities (if any). The third part overviews discussions of intentionality, consciousness, and selfhood. Upon successful completion of the course, the students will acquire the requisite skills to understand some of the main discussions of the field and articulate arguments for and against different positions and examine them critically.   The course outcome:  To develop the skill to read and write about topics presented in the course and similar topics. To understand and critically discuss the basic metaphysical and epistemological views on the nature of the mind and its relationship with the body. To be able to see the relation between epistemological and metaphysical views on the one hand and some fundamental theories of the cognitive sciences and computer science on the other. To be able to reconstruct and critically evaluate the main replies to the questions about the nature of the mind and its relationship with the world.     Sources: The mandatory text for each session is marked by “*”. The students need to read mandatory texts ahead of each session so as to be prepared for well-informed participations. There are also further readings.     Coursework and distribution of grades: Reading reports: Each student must submit (via email to mbeni@metu.edu.tr) three reading reports. The reports could be based on any of the core texts that will be studied during the semester, but the students must submit their report before Monday of the week during which the respective text will be discussed in the classroom. The reading reports are supposed to be around 300 words, identifying the main thesis and extracting the basic structure of the argument of the author. Reading reports amount to 15% of the grade. Participation: participations mainly consist of oral discussions during sessions. They are supposed to be well-informed and thoughtful and are highly valued in this course. They include 15% of the grade, group presentations included. For group presentations, students could form groups of up to 5 people. Intermediate exams: there are two intermediate exams, closed book, during the fifth and ninth weeks of the semester. It constitutes 30% of the student’s grade. Final exam: it is opened-book, the students could use their laptops and have access to the internet, they are required to choose one topic amongst three suggested ones and write one short essay between 2000-3000 words about the topic. 40% of the grade is for the final exam.   Attendance policy: Attendance is important. When unable to attend for an important reason such as illness or family emergency, the student may discuss the situation with me as soon as possible (preferably through email, before the session). Medical certificates and so on need to be sent to me through student affairs or registrar office.   Plaigarism:  When using material that is not their own, students must make sure that they cite the author or appropriately refer to them.

Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY.
Objective: PHIL408. PHILOSOPHY OF MIND II  Lecturer: Majid D. Beni Email: mbeni@metu.edu.tr   Course description:  The course introduces and explores the main issues about selfhood and phenomenal states, including the following ones; what is the self? Are the selves substances? How they retain their identity over time, what is the bearing of modern scientific findings in cognitive psychology and neuroscience on our conception of the self?  What is consciousness, and how it is related to the self? How to account for the social aspects of the self? The course considers some of the significant philosophical replies to those questions, at times by building upon state-of-the-art scientific theories. Upon successful completion of the course, the students will acquire the requisite skills to understand some of the main discussions of the field and articulate arguments for and against different positions and examine them critically.   The course outcome:  To develop the skill to read and write about topics presented in the course and similar topics. To understand and critically discuss the basic metaphysical and epistemological views on the nature of the self, its phenomenal aspects, and its social aspects. To be able to see the relation between epistemological and metaphysical views on the one hand and some fundamental theories of the cognitive sciences and computational neuroscience on the other. To be able to reconstruct and critically evaluate the main replies to the questions about the nature of the mind and its relationship with the world.     Sources: The students need to read texts ahead of each session so as to be prepared for well-informed participation.

Objective: No objective
Content:  This course examines the philosophies of the three leading thinkers of the 17th century: Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz. The emphasis is on the central theses associated with rationalism: (i) that at least some of our concepts are not gained from experience but are innate; and (ii) that reason alone can provide us with knowledge of the external world through `intuition` of self-evident propositions and through `deduction` from those propositions. Selections from the most important works of these philosopherswill be read. Epistemological, metaphysical, ontological, and ethical issues of the Continental Rationalism will be investigated with reference to these central theses. Relations between Continental Rationalism and British Empiricism will be brought into view.

Course: PHIL421
Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY.
Objective: Intensive study of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason; the problem of metaphysics and the self-criticism of reason; Kant’s Copernican turn; the constitutive role of concepts in knowledge; the possibility of synthetic a priori knowledge; the cognitive faculties of the human mind; Kant’s theory of representation; the questions of the ends, the limits and the vocation of human reason. Our text will be the Critique of Pure Reason. The central theme of the course will be Kant’s criticism of metaphysics which finds its formulation in “transcendental idealism”.  This theme obviously extends to the question of the ends, the limits and the vocation of human reason. The aim of the course is to provide a way of entrance to Kant’s system of Critiques, which is highly influential and significant for the history of philosophy. At the end of this course the students will learn: *Kant's critical philosophy *Basic concepts of the Kantian theoretical philosophy   
Content:  This course will be concerned with Immanuel Kant`s most famous and influential work Critique of Pure Reason. After a brief introduction to Kant`s philosophy and its relation to empiricist and rationalist philosophies, we will pay particular attention to Kant`s conception of `critique`. We will trace how Kant explores the possibility of a priori knowledge and of transcendental subjectivity. Finally, we will discuss the problem of the unity of reason, i.e., the unity of reason in its theoretical and practical employment. In this respect, we will bring the first Critique into dialogue with the second Critique.

Content:  This course will be concerned with G.W.F. Hegel`s most famous and influential work Phenomenology of Spirit. After a brief introduction to Hegel`s philosophy and its relation to Kantian philosophy, we will pay particular attention to Hegel`s conception of `phenomenological method`. We will trace how Hegel explores the development of consciousness from its most ordinary form as `spirit`. Finally, we will bring Hegel`s thought into dialogue with contemporary continental philosophies.

Objective: At the end of this course, the student will learn Nietzsche's critique of Western traditional metaphysics and morality Nietzsche's relation to Kant and Schopenhauer academic reading and writing skills 
Content:  Kants analysis of the principles underlying morality leads him to the statement of the categorical imperative, an idea that has been tremendously influential in the history of moral philosophy, yet also widely misunderstood. In this course we will first of all study the various formulations of the categorical imperative in Kants Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals. But in order to be able to assess the status of Kants moral philosophy in the history of philosophy, we will also look at a number of influential figures who  in their different ways  can be seen to have gone beyond Kant in their understanding of the role, status and functioning of morality.

In this course, both eighteenth and twentieth-century perspectives on the Enlightenment will be examined.
Course: PHIL433
Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY.
Objective: David Hilbert, a 20th century logician, famously said: “The infinite! No other question has ever moved so profoundly the spirit of man; no other idea has so fruitfully stimulated his intellect; yet no other concept stands in greater need of clarification….” As pointed out by Hilbert, the concept of infinity has been an important topic in philosophy since the time of early Greek philosophers. In addition to its philosophical importance, it also has significant mathematical aspects. For example, the concept forms the basis of some counter-intuitive mathematical results, such as being able to paint an infinite surface with a finite amount of paint. Thus, a thorough investigation of the concept of infinity will need to have both a philosophical dimension and a mathematical/logical dimension. This proposed course aims to provide such an investigation. The investigation will be carried out in three overlapping dimensions: historical, metaphysical, and mathematical. In the first dimension, the development of the concept of infinity will be traversed, starting from early Greek thought and ending with 20th century views on infinity. The main focus of the metaphysical dimension of the course will be the distinction between potential infinity and actual infinity. The arguments for and against the existence of actual infinity will be thoroughly examined. In addition to these arguments, the metaphysical dimension of the course will also include an analysis of human finitude and the possibility of infinite beings. The mathematical dimension will cover early paradoxes of motion and time, Galileo’s “paradox”, Torricelli’s trumpet, Cantor’s transfinite mathematics, and some theorems relevant to the discussion of infinity.

Objective: Course Description:  The main subject matter of this course will be the concept or phenomenon of death where we will be reading and evaluating principally contemporary literature. In the first half of the course we will discuss inter alia the following: our conception of the human soul; the onto-epistemology of death; common conception of death as being “mysterious”; death and literature (the case of Elias Canetti); the contemporary approach to aging and dying in our culture; characterization of life as fabulae; and the existential-hermeneutic philosophy (specifically, Martin Heidegger’s view) regarding death as the ultimate phenomenological limit. In the second half of the course we will focus chiefly on the notion of “harm due to dying”.  We will start with a classical view presented by Epicurus (4th cent. B.C.E.) and study the contemporary reaction the his “harm argument”.  We will also briefly discuss the Ancient and Spinozistic approaches to death.  Another major issue we will talk about will be the concept of immortality.  We will examine the notion of immortality, and then consider the pertinent analyses and philosophically evaluate its desirability.

Objective: This course is designed to present a general overview to the field of cultural and cross-cultural psychology and introduce you to the idea of cultural variation in human behavior. In doing this it examines only a small selection of the theoretical, empirical and applied issues of human behavior across cultures. The rationale behind this course is that what may hold true in many contemporary, Western European and North American societies is not necessarily the norm in other societies. In order to better understand these differences, we will examine psychological constructs and theories through relativist and universalist perspectives, sometimes referred to as cultural psychology and cross-cultural psychology, respectively. This examination will seek to compare and contrast what is universal in human behavior and what is shaped and interpreted by cultural variations.

Objective: The terms “urban” and “politics” went hand in hand throughout the history. As Lefebvre puts: “There is politics of space because space is political”. Urban life embraced power and politics from the very emergence of the human settlements. The aim of this course is to introduce the students to the basic concepts and theories of political power, state, local state and their analysis in urban context. The course is organized into three parts. The first part is devoted to the methodological problems which is indispensable for the scientific analysis of social and political issues. Such an introduction is a must, to comprehend, evaluate and debate the material presented in the latter sections of the course properly. Part two examines in a summary manner the theories developed about the state (i.e. the ultimate organization of political power) in general and the capitalist state in particular. Part three deals with the local state, the role played by and functions fulfilled by the state in urban context. The course will be conducted in a lecturedemonstration mode. Readings are to be regarded as reference material, “suggested” rather than “required”. Because of the length of the overall list, students will be expected to read selectively- choosing some areas for intensive reading and others for skimming according to particular interests.  
Content:  Structured around the urban life. Embraces power and politics from the very emergence of the human settlements. Introduction to the basic concepts and theories of political power, state, local state and their analysis in urban context.

Objective: This course will introduce students the importance of outdoor education for young children. Moreover, the characteristics of ideal outdoor environment, risk and safety in outdoor environment will be studied. The course will also focus on the pedagogies related to nature-based education, the relation between sustainability and outdoor education. In addition, participants in this course will be provided strategies to plan planning outdoor activities for young children and effective teacher strategies in outdoor environments.   
Content:  The importance of outdoor play is widely acknowledged by early childhood researchers.  However, studies, which are conducted to investigate teachers outdoor play practices, proposed educational implications in relation to in-service and pre-service training programs about outdoor education. They suggested that in-service and pre-service teacher training programs are needed about facilitation of childrens outdoor play by teachers. As those researchers indicated, in-service teacher training could be one way to form teachers beliefs and improve their outdoor play practices. However, when teachers are graduated from university and participated to the regular system, they have generally configured their beliefs in relation to teaching and learning. When it is considered that beliefs are resistant to change, the role of pre-service teacher training programs in constructing pre-service teachers beliefs becomes more crucial. In other words, pre-service teacher training programs might be more effective to construct pre-service teachers beliefs of outdoor education and to make them capable in terms of facilitating childrens outdoor play and learning. In this regard, several research that have been conducted to examine the role of pre-service teacher training programs in forming pre-service teachers beliefs constitute an evidence for this foresight. From this point of view, providing an outdoor education course for pre-service teachers would be golden opportunity to train qualified and capable students in the issue of outdoor education. In addition, in Turkey, curriculum for early childhood education suggested teachers to conduct learning activities in outdoor environment as much as possible. Based on this guide curriculum, teachers are expected to create their own plans. At that point, as the teachers will be decision makers of the curriculum and classroom it is important to make pre-service students to develop positive attitudes toward outdoor education. Due to aforementioned reasons, presenting a course for outdoor education is significant for pre-service early childhood teacher training program.

Content:  Disasters are fundamentally sociological events. First of all, the course will try to discuss how to sociologically conceptualize  what a `disaster`is? what is a `hazard`? What is a`hazard risk`? Why we cannot justify the term `natural` to explain disasters? How can we understand the root drivers behind disasters? The course will then continue with a brief analysis of different theoretical discussions and sociological perspectives for understanding disasters? The course will continue explaining how disasters may enhance the previous social inequalities before and may lead to multidimensional, contextual and intersectional vulnerabilities during and after the disasters. The course will then focus on the difference between `disaster risk management` and `disaster risk reduction` approaches. While the first one is emphasizing the period after a disaster, the later refers to preventive strategies, referring to risk perception, awareness and preparedness. The role of NGOs will be also covered in the course. Especially there will be a discussion on whether we can talk of a  `recovery` or a major social change after a disaster. In the course, various major disasters experienced in the world will be presented. Among them disaster/climate change induced migration will be particularly emphasized.

Objective:  Introduce students to the research in environmental sociology and to emphasize how a sociological perspective can inform our understanding of changes in the natural world. Although environmental sociology encompasses a large and growing literature, the course will focus upon several prominent works and will introduce students to the fundamental issues and debates in the field. Promote students’ ability to evaluate the existing research and to understand its implications. Class discussions, lectures, writing assignments, and the final paper will all help in the realization of this goal. Promote the development of a global perspective on environmental issues. Just as processes of environmental and social change are linked, developments originating in isolated regions often have worldwide implications. Conversely, global trends are often particularly manifest in specific locales. This course will attempt to make those critical connections evident. Enhance students’ writing and research abilities. Toward this end, each student in the course will complete regular writing assignments and a research paper.  
Content:  Environmental sociology is a field of inguiry that focuses on the relationship between society and the biophysical environment. This course will consider social relationships at both the global and local levels, as well as in urban and rural localities. It examines how human societies affect the environment and how human societies are shaped by the environment.

Objective: This course examines and compares cultures through materials and practices embedded in everyday life with anthropological perspectives.  One of the most important subjects of everyday life is food.  Food is more than sustenance; it is our lifestyle, a nexus among people, it brings memories and nostalgia.  Through food we create and present our identities (e.g., national, regional, religious, ethnic, gender and class); for example, tamales are significant food among Mexicans and South Americans.  Does it follow that the consumption of tamales signifies regionalism or nationalism?  Are all pizza Italian?  Is pizza served at American franchised restaurants Italian or American cuisine?  Is barbeque for men more than for women and sweets for women more than men?  How do people feel nostalgic for foreign originated food?  Do people consume no meat for good health or for political statement?  The relationships between food and people are complex.  And, it is an individual researcher’s goal to discover, analyze and interpret the complexity. By exploring foodways—the traditions and customs in production, consumption and distribution of food—of others and ours, we will learn the different ways of using food to create and present identities; how and in what circumstances people use food to distinguish them from one another as well as connect with others?  How do they recreate new identities or diminish old ones in order to be accepted in new places or by new people?  The primary goal of this course is to develop a critical awareness of cultural similarities as much as differences.  Throughout the course, you should always ask yourself: What is culture?  We study food as an academic subject through readings, films and class/group discussions.  There are no right and wrong opinions as each of us have a different background, which has shaped our perspectives.  However, you should be thinking about food in terms of anthropology.  As a final project, you will do a food-based research paper—to examine food of other culture rather than your own, such as outside your region, ethnicity, religion, class, and gender.  In your paper, you should pose a central research question, for example, “How do people in America present their class identity through sushi consumption?” or “How is simit significant to everyday life in Turkey?”  By examining the ways by which others shape their identity through food, you learn about their culture and people.  This helps you to be self-reflective with your own culture as well.  In your research paper, you should discuss how a particular food impacts people’s everyday life and the ways by which they form their identities.  
Content:  The course probes such social and cultural questions as  ´Are there different kinds of rationality? ´,  ´Does language limit and control thought? ´,  ´What kind of difficulties arise when we attempt to translate from one language, or culture, into another?,  ´Are there universal moral principles? ´,  ´Is it possible to compare different cultures? ´ Basic concepts such as self, reason and sanity, money and wealth, religious beliefs, and health will be subjected to critique.

Objective: The course examines the formation and dynamics of ethnic groups in the contemporary world. It surveys major topics, theoretical definitions/debates and approaches in the field of race and ethnicity. Moreover, it also examines social and ethnic relations as part of larger social systems by emphasizing the relationship between ethnicity on the one hand and nations, state, class, minority groups, gender, power, and politics on the other.   The aim of the course is to provide academic background, conceptual clarity, and guidance to the students around the key concepts of race and ethnicity. Classical studies on nationalism and state-formation emphasize territoriality, clearly delimited boundaries, and a homogenous population with a focus on universalism, inclusion, civility, modern tolerance, transnational integration and civic nationhood. The increasing emphasis on particularity, exclusion, violence, ancient hatreds, and national disintegration (stemming mainly from the post-communist east Europe and the former Soviet Union and the increasing number of immigrants in Europe) constitutes a challenge to the analytical gains of the mainstream literature on nationalism. In this context ethnic group formation, ethnic integration and ethnic conflict appear among the defining phenomena of the modern era. While one understanding in the field of race and ethnicity emphasizes membership in definite groups (similarity), the other emphasizes cultural differentiation (difference); both aiming to explain and understand human diversity through the processes of social identification and interaction. Ethnic integration and ethnic conflict can be divided into several sub-categories, such as assimilation, melting pot or cultural pluralism (multiculturalism) on the one hand and discrimination, ethnic cleansing or genocide on the other. Since ethnic groups can (and often do) generate various forms of conflict, ethnicity appears as one of the most controversial topics in the literature. Most theoretical approaches to understanding racial and ethnic identification or racial and ethnic relations remain inconclusive. Thus, it is important to emphasize a broader understanding of the concept of ethnicity as a social phenomenon. Ethnicity also has political, historical, economic, and religious dimensions none of which can be ignored. In this context, conceptions like “the return of the repressed” or “elite manipulation” need to be critically reconsidered in relation to the concepts of collective identity (and its expressive forms) and (ethnic and racial) social movements.

Objective: The aim of this course is to study on the subject of city culture in the global world within a framework of  interdisciplinary approach and develop some field methods and put them in application in order to enable students to explore different aspects of the city culture that they live in.   Exploration of the cultures of cities requires to ask a series of questions: How do cities use culture? Who plays a leading role in the formation of cities’ cultures? Who controls the “symbolic economy” of the cities as Zukin (1994) uses the term? Who really occupy the central spaces of cities? Which components of a city life are essential for the formation of city cultures? How does the history of a city play a role in the formation of its current cultural characteristics? How are the city cultures embodied by its inhabitants and which inhabitants embody which characteristics of  city cultures? In short how the cultures of cities are produced, consumed and reproduced by whom? And finally how all these questions can be applied to Ankara, the capital of Turkey.  
Content:  City Culture in the global world with an interdisciplinary world with an interdisciplinary approach: field methods and their application on different aspects of the city culture throughout different socio-economic and political periods; Ankara as the capital of Turkey and city culture in Ankara and Turkish modernization.

Course: SOC466
Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY.
Objective: Course Description This is a reading and writing intensive seminar on human beings’ universal metabolic relationship with the rest of nature and the manifold historical-geographical forms this relationship takes. Moving from the European colonial expansion and the Caribbean transnationalism as a starting point of problematization, our discussion will often revolve broadly around the intersection of political economy and political ecology. We will critically discuss such issues as the relational and intersecting processes of appropriation of nature through human labor, the production of space and social ecologies; appropriation of labor’s surplus by the owners of the means of production; and the relational and transnational formation of social identities such as race, ethnicity, and gender through a historical perspective both in colonial and post-colonial contexts across the globe. Course Objectives:  To introduce and debate the relationality among the labor regimes, surplus extraction, land ownership systems and the construction of various social identities along different axes of social difference such as race, gender, ethnicity, and nationality. To problematize and discuss the differences between, imperialism, transnationalism, colonialism, post-colonialism, nationalism, and universalism through a historical materialist framework by specifically examining class formations, land ownership and labor regimes in the context of the emergence and consolidation of European political modernity. To discuss how above-mentioned processes are integral to the production of socio-ecological environments various peoples lived in and the historical formation of contemporary globalized political-ecological issues.      Course Requirements Attendance and Participation (20%) Attending the seminar: 1 point each week (14 Points in Total) Attending the discussion: 6 Points in total Inasmuch as you are free to come and go to our seminars as you like as free individuals, this course will evaluate your ability to bring your bodies and ideas into the classroom. There is a reason for such tyranny: The true gift of seminars is its collectivity, or what Marx calls “the natural advantages of cooperation” in the production process. It is in the classroom where we have a chance to express the way we read texts, hear others’ way of reading them, and challenge ourselves and our fellow readers in a fruitful collective environment. Honest intellectual engagement in class discussions is, after all, the most challenging demand this course will impose on you.      Critical Discussion Leading (10%)  Throughout the semester each of you will spin-off the in-class discussion with a presentation that should take 10-to-15-minutes. If the number of students exceed 13, this presentation can be done in pairs, in which case the two parts of the presentation should not exceed 20 minutes in total. You are expected to critically review the assignments of the week, lay down the main arguments and major points of discussion and put them into a dialogue with each other and the other texts of the syllabus whenever possible. Note that this excludes simple summaries. The primary aim of this exercise is to encourage you to construct a productive intellectual engagement with the assigned texts rather than being passive recipients. The experience from the past few semesters shows that it becomes very productive when you come up with critical questions derived from the text(s) to enrich your presentation. This enables us to pick up those questions to facilitate the discussion. When there are multiple texts in a particular week, you are expected to cover all the assigned readings and metabolize them in a single presentation. Note that the presentations that are unable to lay down the main arguments and crucial points of discussion in 15 minutes (20 if there are two presenters) and take longer are subject to point loss. It is an important skill to be able structure your talk in a time that is allocated to you, be it 5 minutes, 15 minutes or more. It is possible to identify the main arguments and major points of discussion of any text in 15 minutes, unless you try to summarize it.    Reading Notes (21%) Throughout the semester you will write two-page response papers to seven weekly assignments of your choice. Each will account for 3% of your final grade. The principles of discussion leading applies to the notes as well. I would like you to critically discuss the assigned texts but given that you have two pages, you are encouraged to pick a point or two that you identify as interesting, important or vital for understanding the texts. You may again put these points into a dialogue with other texts of the course whenever possible. Note that this excludes simple summaries. The papers should be uploaded to turn-it-in until midnight on Tuesdays in order to facilitate the in-class discussion the next day. Since late papers would defeat this purpose, they will not be evaluated. You should come prepared to make those points and be able to defend them in the classroom when necessary. Term Paper (50%) You will submit a final paper at the end of the semester. Your term paper topic is entirely up to you, i.e., you can problematize any aspect of this course, as long as it inspires you, be it theoretical/conceptual or empirical. You can consult me anytime if you are not sure how your intended paper topic could address the debates covered throughout the semester. No matter what your topic is about, I expect you to construct your research topic, produce clear research questions, which will then determine the literature you will review in order to situate your paper and your arguments. This holistic and relational methodology/epistemology will be part of our discussions throughout the semester, which will help you with the construction of your paper. Your papers should be 15-20 pages. (Double-spaced, times new roman font, size 12.) Academic dishonesty and the expropriation of labor of others in any form will not be tolerated. This is not because you have to respect the intellectual private property rights, but the labor of others. 
Content:  The course explores the relational and intersecting processes of appropriation of nature through human labor, the production of space and social ecologies; appropriation of the surplus created by labor by the owners of the means of production; formation of social identities such as race, ethnicity and class through a historical perspective both in colonial and post-colonial contexts across the globe.

Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY.
Objective: The question of secularism has become an issue of intense theoretical and political debate in recent decades. This is mostly due to a revival of religion as global fact. Recent developments such as fundamentalist upsurges (Islamic or Evangelical), the growing Muslim population in Western countries and the resurgence of religion in world affairs have put religion and secularism among the crucial issues for many Western and Eastern societies including Turkey. Thus, the issue of secularism has become a major research topic for sociologists.      
Content:  This course aims to acquaint students with the secularization debate. Enlightenment, secularizing effect of modernity, classical theories of secularization and recent approaches, different dimensions of secularization and Western secularisms will be critically analyzed. The development of secularism in different Western countries will be studied with a comparative perspective. 
Course: SOC498
Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY.
Objective: Secularism has become a subject of intense theoretical and political debate in recent decades. This is mostly due to a revival of religion as a global fact. Developments such as Islamic fundamentalist upsurges and the resurgence of religion in world affairs after the events of 9/11, and more recently, the formation of ISIS, the Charlie Hebdo attack have put religion and secularism among the crucial issues not only in Western societies but also in Muslim-minority and Muslim-majority societies including Turkey. These recent developments have also brought questions about free speech into sharp focus. Decreasing commitment to traditional religions and the modern disconnection between faith communities and socio-cultural identities via the development of new religious movements are conducive to the development of fundamentalism. Also, individualization of faith and the disassociation of faith communities from ethnic and national identities are becoming widespread. In other words, the divide between culture and religion is growing as an important social fact and thus, attracting the attention of many sociologists. Especially since the so called ‘war on terror’, the academic debate over the compatibility of Islam with secularism and democracy has become a subject of public discussion and thus, the issue of secularism a major research topic for sociologists. The main debates that the sociologists studying religion and secularism are engaged in, are as follows: The relationship between secularism/secular state and democracy; the place of Shari’a in Muslim societies; The relationship between Islam and the state throughout the history of Islam; the (im)possibility of realizing an ‘Islamic State’; the (possible) consequences of the coercive enforcement of Shari’a by the state; the threat of majoritarianism; the perception of Islamic upsurge in the West; the failure of the idea that we are living in a secular world, especially considering the limited secularization and secularism experienced in Muslim societies; the axiomatic nature of belief in the Muslim world as opposed to the West; attempts of creating a secular ethic and the difficulty in determining the principles of such ethic through a consensus; and the visibility of  religious markers in the public space have been hot topics for sociologists studying religion and secularism.  The study of Muslim-minority and Muslim-majority societies, especially of the case of Turkey, will contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between Islam, secularization and the secular state; the increasingly important role that religion plays in these societies and the debates over the importance of secularism for the establishment of democratic political regimes.     
Content:  The principal aim of this course is to acquaint students with the secularization process, the secular state in predominantly Muslim societies and also in Muslim-minority states. Experience of secularization, laicité and secular state, and the relationship between Islam and politics will be critically and comparatively examined in different countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Egypt, Iran, Israel and Turkey.

Objective: Here are the words of  Serdar Devrim from Hürriyet Ä°K, dated     June 7, 2015   “Neden olmuyor acaba?”  “ You have looked through his CV, his LinkedIn account, called his references, searched for his traces on social media, invited him for an interview 2-3 times to test his patience and nerves, and, finally, you have hired the CEO’s wife’s best friend’s daughter… Just kidding! You have found the one who is closest to being the right person for the right job and hired him. Depending, of course, on how lucky you were(!). You have agreed on salary, benefits, working conditions and the actual job to be done, and shaken hands.    Let’s say; you are great manager, a superb HR person and you knew very well what you wanted and who you were looking for. You carried out the recruitment process perfectly. Still yet, every hire is a gamble, a dice-roll, getting a double-six has a probability of 1 in 36. There will for sure be some lack of knowledge and objectivity. The situation is the same for the hired personnel. How well did she introduce herself? Besides, how well does she know herself? How deliberately, objectively and well did she decide? How well did she know the company? How well did she understand what is expected from her? etc, etc…                The interviewing process is a kind of sales activity. In this case, you are the product and the salesperson. In this course you are going to practice how to “sell” yourself  to your prospective employer.  An interview of 15-30 minutes could change all your professional carrier, even your life; like the university exam you had entered 4 years ago.

Objective: The course instructs on the philosophy of science and philosophy of language, two distinct areas of philosophy arguably at the heart of the concept of academic learning. The instruction aims to facilitate an exploration of the question of method for social and political research in the wider setting of human sciences. The so-called second great debate within the discipline of International Relations, roughly between traditionalism and behavioralism, is arguably still key to the assessments of method in the study area. The course seeks to inform students on this debate in the context of the overall question of method in social and political research towards generating knowledge. Students are expected to gain skills and competencies in relation to a basic set of issues in research.  What is knowledge? What is fact? How is knowledge claimed to be generated in academic research? What exactly is research? What are the possibly inherent limitations in digging for data? In what specific ways do researchers suggest possible distinctions between fact and value? What to make of concepts such as theory, interpretation, objectivity and subjectivity in the acquisition and use of social and political data?  
Content:  The aim of the course is to provide students with a basic knowledge of research methods in the social sciences, with special emphasis on research methods in International Relations. The course has the twofold aim of acquainting students with epistemological issues in the conduct of research in the social  sciences, while also providing students with practical research skills ,including research design, data collection and analysis, and use  of library resources.

Content:  Global order has changed with the end of the Cold War. The old defining struggle between a capitalist West and a communist East has passed. Since then, some key policy discussions led by the North have linked national and international security to questions about potential future dangers of social and political disruptions resulting from environment degradation and economic underdevelopment in the South. Once again the world is divided into the North and the South, with the North making decisions to maintain global political and economic status quo –inadequate distribution of natural resources and wealth-  and safeguarding security, and the South being managed without its consent. This course aims to provide the students with a comprehensive understanding of the North-South relations from the perspective of environment, development and security.

Objective: Is war (the use of force in international politics) reducible to a science with immutable facts and logics? If so, what is the utility of strategy and how does it relate to international relations? How does any of this help decisionmakers obtain security? For that matter, what even is security and how does it contrast with peace? If you have ever had any questions like these, Security and Strategy will be a great starting point. The goal of this course is to familiarize students with concepts like strategy and security, introduce them to the International Security subfield of IR, and discuss specialized topics that lie at the intersection of IR Theory, Security, and Anthropology. By the conclusion of this course, students can expect to develop a precise understanding of the concept of strategy with its numerous nuances, the role of force in world politics, and deliberate on the precise origins and meanings of concepts like war and peace. The students will also receive an introduction into basic debates in Security Studies as they learn about traditional topics such as war and nuclear deterrence, as well as more recent discussions about political violence, non-state actors, and the illicit global economy. 
Content:  This course examines the range of security threats that the international community faces at the beginning of the new millennium and discusses, both at the level of discourse and the level of practice, how the international community is responding to the persistence of such threats as nuclear proliferation and terrorism and the emergence of new ones such as chemical and biological warfare, pandemics and mass migration. Special emphasis will be placed on comparing and contrasting traditional security paradigm with newly emerging ones, as well as their complex interaction.

Objective: At the end of this course students will learn; The domestic political framework of Turkish foreign policy. Evolution of Turkey's political system. The impact of political actors, institutions, and ideologies in the domestic and foreign policy of Turkey. 
Content:  Foreign policy has conventionally been understood as detached from the domestic policy environment. This is derived from the realist assumption that there exists a clear demarcation line between the domestic and the international. Yet this assumption has been questioned by theoretical analysis as well as practical developments in recent years. This course aims at elaborating domestic sources of foreign policy making in the context of Turkish politics. It is based on the hypothesis that an `interactional` approach better serves to the understanding of both Turkish domestic politics and Turkish foreign policy. Thus the course will explain domestic sources of foreign policy issues, like democratization, human rights, the Kurdish question, the role of the military in Turkish politics etc.

Objective: The first part of the course deals with the basics, which includes an engagement with the foundational concepts of the IR discipline as well as the concept of “theory” itself. In the second part of the course, we discuss the major paradigms –a concept you will become familiar with in this course– of IR. Paradigms for our purposes refer to the totality of assumptions, thought patterns, theories, research questions, methods, and programs pertaining to a collectively imagined framing of the social world. Part III examines the important omissions. Many of the major paradigms proceed from a structural understanding of world politics that focus on the interactions of states. They tend not to engage with deeper issues of world politics such as its main constituent actors like the state. We need to grapple with the nexus of system and unit-level phenomena by situating the state historically and among major IR theories. Next, we assess the state of knowledge production the discipline, focusing not only on the relative neglect of non-Western approaches to IR but also by problematizing the omission of gender as a significant factor in world politics. We will end the course by discussing the future of the international order via an appraisal/critique of contemporary U.S. foreign policy. At this point, students will be well placed to excel in their final take-home exam. The final, Part IV, looks at contemporary, critical and emancipatory aspects of IR Theory by scrutinizing the constituent elements of the social world and the power dynamics therein. It asks students to think about what other kinds of hierarchies exist in the social world.

Course: ADM1324
Department: This course belongs to department of POLITICAL SCIENCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION.
Objective: For most of human history, humans lived in small groups who hunted and gathered their food, but around 8,000 B.C., things changed. Humans developed agriculture, settled in urban communities and eventually built huge empires, created religious institutions and explored the planet. In many areas of life, civilization brought about striking improvements and innovations. On the other hand, oppression, exploitation, and massive human suffering accompanied civilizations.   The goal of this course is to provide you with a foundation for understanding the world in which we live, keeping in mind humanity’s accomplishments as well as failures. Learning about history is not just memorizing a sequence of events, or a bunch of facts and dates; the point is to critically examine continuity and change over time. The large scope of this course will encourage more synthesis of ideas and integration of knowledge than thorough information on particular topics.   The course is arranged so as to avoid two common pitfalls of teaching and learning about civilizations. First, it will be stressed that the global dominance of Europe is a phenomenon that occurred only after c. 1500 and it is a mistake to project it backwards and read the whole world history from the perspective of European hegemony.  Secondly, historians of civilizations usually tell the stories of glorious empires, states, armies, monuments, wars, treaties, great men, etc. and tend to ignore women, the poor, peasants, slaves, and so on. In this course, we will put special emphasis on how important historical developments influenced those social groups who have traditionally been written off of history.

Course: AEE331
Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING.
Objective: The main objective of this course is to familiarize the students with the basic 3 heat transfer modes, namely conduction, convection and radiation, which are common in aerospace systems. The students are also equipped with the ability to identify the existing heat transfer mode(s) on a given problem, and then to analyze the problem by determining the involved heat transfer rates or temperature distributions. The relevant system of equations or differential equations is formed simply by the conservation of energy principle applied to a control volume of finite size or differential size. Following the introduction of Fourier's law for heat conduction, and derivation of the general heat diffusion equation in three dimensions, equations are simplified for one-dimensional problems. Applications to plane walls, with and without thermal energy generation (heat sources), extended bodies (fins), and non-uniform cross sections with quasi one-dimensional approach are made. The concept of equivalent thermal circuit and thermal resistance to conduction heat transfer is introduced. While solving one-dimensional conduction problems with convection over a surface and/or radiation, Newton's law of cooling for convection heat transfer that develops across the thermal boundary layer and/or the black body radiation formula are used for providing the necessary boundary condition at the surface. Following one-dimensional problems, an analytical solution method is taught for treating two-dimensional linear conduction problems without volumetric heat generation. Fundamental knowledge for drawing constant temperature lines (isotherms) and heat flow lines (adiabats) is also provided to appreciate heat transfer phenomena across 2-D bodies. Transient conduction is treated analytically for complex shapes using the lumped capacitance method, and for simple shapes with 1-D conduction solving the full diffusion equation. The use of the non-dimensional Biot number is explained in transient conduction problems. The convection heat transfer mode is observed extensively in aerospace applications. Regarding this heat transfer mode, the fundamental physics pertaining to it is discussed first. For this velocity and thermal boundary layer equations are derived, and then non-dimensionalized, leading to the definitions of the Reynolds number, Prandtl number. By equating the conduction heat transfer at the surface but on the fluid side to convection heat transfer definition the so-called Nusselt number is obtained and this is shown to equal nothing but the fluid's dimensionless temperature gradient at the surface. Both analytical and experimental functions are given for the Nusselt number for various flow configurations. Internal flow convection problems are also treated. Free convection is shown to exist when gravitational effects are important. Relevant dimensionless parameters are discussed and Nusselt number correlations are given for some simple configurations, such as flat plate and horizontal infinite cylinder.  Fundamental concepts of radiation heat transfer are taught.  
Content:  Basic concepts. One-dimensional steady-state conduction, extended surfaces, two-dimensional steady-state conduction, shape factors, transient conduction.

Course: CE241
Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING.
Objective: All engineers are concerned with the structural safety, serviceability and the economics of the constructions with which they are involved. The successful approach to the problem can only be established through a sound knowledge of computational methods of engineering and a thorough understanding of the properties and behavior of engineering materials. Without a proper knowledge of materials neither the structural safety and serviceability nor the economics can be achieved in engineering projects. The purpose of this course is to emphasize the basic principles necessary for an understanding of the fundamental nature and properties of engineering materials and to make clear the significance of these principles in engineering practice. The objective has been to present a unified treatment of a variety of materials, stressing the fundamentals which provide a common basis for explaining the behavior of the varied materials. The organization of the course material is such that, first, the elements of the atomic and electronic structure of matter are introduced and the structure types of solids are explained. Then, the physicochemical aspects of the colloidal material used in industrial practice are covered.  A sequence proceeds from atomic structures to coarser structures, from the simple to the more complex. Such a sequence from atoms to crystals, to phases, to microstructures and to macrostructures is followed because the grosser structures and properties depend on the finer structural characteristics. Considering the importance of the mechanical behavior of materials and the limitation of the course period, emphasis is given to the phenomena associated with the mechanical behavior of the materials and their structural characteristics. Elasticity, plasticity and flow phenomena are explained by reference to the main types of engineering materials and a discussion of the strength and other related properties of the materials follows. Finally the effect of radiation damage on the mechanical properties of materials is briefly discussed.

Objective: Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. lt literally forms the basis of modern society. There is scarcely any aspect of daily life which does not depend directly or indirectly on concrete. Therefore, the properties of this material need to be known very well. In order to know and realize the importance of properties and the behavior of concrete, the properties of the materials that compose the concrete need to be known as well. The CE students of METU meet with cement and aggregate to a certain extent in their second year course, CE 244 Materials of construction, which includes many other construction materials such as metals, wood, clay products, building stones, lime, gypsum, etc. Due to the time limitation, such aspects as quality of mixing water and the types of admixtures used for concrete are not taught in CE 344. There is no other course for the CE students related to the concrete making materials during their BS program. During their brief study of cement and aggregate in the second year, the students usually do not realize the importance of these materials and they graduate without any further knowledge of their characteristics. Therefore, this course on “Concrete-Making Materials” is planned to furnish the fourth year students the necessary information on cements, aggregates, water and admixtures. Those students who will have the opportunity to take such a course will not only learn these materials but also properly to evaluate their importance from the technical and economic viewpoints.

Content:  Many of the philosophical schools of antiquity saw philosophy as the ´art of living´ rather than merely teaching abstract theory or the exegesis of texts. Philosophical practice is an attempt by philosophers to return philosophy to its ancient and practical roots. The course, therefore, is an inquiry into the role of philosophy in our daily life. For this purpose ideas of of great philosophers from Pythagoras to Postmodenism are discussed and moral, aesthetic and political implications of their views of philosophy and practice are studied and criticized. 
Course: PHIL235
Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY.
Objective: Logic is the study of "good" reasoning. We all have some basic intuitions about what counts as "good" or "acceptable" reasoning, but those intuitions fail most of the time, especially in cases where reasoning is more complex. Logic is the discipline that formalizes those intuitions so that the failure of distinguishing "good" reasoning from "bad" reasoning is minimized. In this course, we will study one of the two main types of logic, i.e. deductive logic (the other being inductive logic). The topics  that will be covered are validity, soundness, truth-table methods, natural deduction proof techniques and some metatheorems. The course will be useful for any student who aims to improve his/her analytical thinking skills. 
Content:  Logic as a formal science; inference, implication, validity and truth; syllogism.

Is the censorship of pornography ethically justified? What are our moral obligations with respect to the environment and what is the appropriate moral foundation for those obligations?. After developing some skill in identifying ethical and moral arguments and disagreement on such issues, major ethical theories such as utilitarianism, Kantianism,    egoism, etc., will be applied to these moral problems. In order to fulfill this aim, several concrete and pressing moral problems will be chosen. The student will be encouraged to write and think clearly about these problems, weighing alternative solutions and criticising those which are weak and untenable. The main focus will be to give the student the skill necessary to identify a moral problem and to introduce her to critical thinking over moral issues. 
Course: PHIL352
Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY.
Objective: When studying a philosophical position, it may be very hard, and even inappropriate to make a distinction between the content of the philosophical position and its form or better the activity itself. However, it can be done so for a pedagogical reason: to learn about the tool-box of philosophical constructions. Moreover, it is a good philosophical practice –yes there is a hidden agenda- because all this boils down to a simple question: what does it mean to engage philosophical practice?

Objective: Important note:  If you are not a philosophy major, you may be allowed to take this course but only if you have taken at least several philosophy (or humanties / social sciences) courses before.  Consult with me if you intend to take the course so that I can assess if your background is adequate. This course is about pragmatism which emerged as a philosophical school in the USA about a century ago and is currently regarded as one of the most influential philosophical perspectives or approaches now.  We will take a look at the original defenders of this movement and then consider some of its more recent proponents.  Our aim is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of pragmatism vis-a-vis its ontological and epistemological aspects and also with regard to its social-political implications.  We will also try to evaluate pragmatism from a broader philosophical perspective, asking the question of how pragmatism views philosophy as an intellectual discipline.  To that end we will focus on Richard Rorty's ideas on truth and the identity of philosophy.  We will discuss Rorty's reading of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and evaluate his controversial construal of Orwell and related ideas. 
Content:  A study of American Pragmatism and its influence on contemporary cultural/intellectual life. Study of the founders of the pragmatist movement such as Charles S. Peirce, William James and John Dewey, the pragmatist critigue of the epistemological and ontological traditions, pragmatism s reaction to intellectual tendencies in philosophy, possible precursors of pragmatists in the 19th century (such as F. Nietzsche), pragmatists views on knowledge, scientific endeavor, morality, social progress, education, and democracy, more recent representatives of pragmatism such as Richard Rorty, the connection between pragmatism and liberalism and totalitarianism, traditional and contemporary reactions to pragmatism, the controversy about pragmatism s position in the philosophical debate between realism and anti-realism.

Department: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF Environmental Engineering.
Objective: This course aims to focus on global challenges facing environmental engineers in the twenty-first century. The course will call upon technical knowledge senior students have gained over the course of the first three years of their education and use this knowledge and their ideas initially to identify and investigate major environmental challenges facing the world, and then grasp and devise ways to contribute to the solution process. From a perspective of holistic engineering education, this course will help actively contextualize the environmental engineer’s role in global debates using a whole systems approach; by integrating in-depth technical knowledge on environmental problems and solutions with topics that provide breadth such as social responsibility, policy and entrepreneurial thinking.  By this approach and exposure to global issues, engineering expertise can be put to use on complex environmental, social, energy, economic and technical challenges of the twenty first century. Through relevant course components (i.e. reading assignments, weekly tasks, discussion hours) students will obtain information and find opportunity to create innovative solutions regarding pressing challenges that the world currently faces and be able to form opinions on these issues from a variety of perspectives. Guest lectures are planned to bring together students with professionals working on such global challenges. Presentations as well as discussion hours involving invited guests will provide an interactive environment in the classroom for fruitful discussions. As opposed to the specific challenges in the field of environmental engineering such as treatment of a particular type of pollutant from wastewater or a gaseous emission, this course aims to provide a larger scale, global framework on environmental issues which will enable a wider perspective for students regarding global problems that the world faces. In such challenges, there may not be one single solution, or approach by professionals of one or two disciplines. Here, environmental engineers are desperately needed to contribute to and perhaps act as the leader for devising solutions in a multi-disciplinary environment.

FAQ Question: I cannot make remote desktop connection, what should I do?
FAQ Answer:   If you are having trouble setting up a remote desktop connection, it may be possible for two reasons. a) The port number used for the connection should be changed b) There is a problem with the remote desktop connection settings or the username  a) The port number used for the connection should be changed Some security measures has been taken about the port 3389 which is used for remote desktop connection to METU campus. Port 3389 keeps closed two-way (campus in and out) because of security reasons. In order to connect to your computer at METU from outside the campus using remote desktop connection, you should change the remote desktop port number for both of the computers. There are two ways to do so: Select Start > Run > regedit. On "Registry Editor" select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ System \ CurrentControlSet \ Control \ TerminalServer \ WinStations \ RDP-Tcp and change the "PortNumber" with any unused port number between 1025 and 65535.  Then, you should give permission to this port number on Windows Firewall. For Windows 7, select Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Firewall > Advanced Settings. For Windows 10, select Start > Windows Administrative Tools > Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security. From the menu on the left side, select Outbound Rules on the computer you are using remote desktop connection, Inbound Rules on the computer you are going to connect remotely. Then click New Rule on the right. If you are going to use both computers to be connected remotely, you should create both inbound and outbound rules on both computers.   On "New Outbound Rule Wizard", select Port as the rule type and click Next. On the next screen choose the protocol as TCP and write down the port number you have defined.   Then, select Allow the connection and click Next. Finally, specify a name for the rule and click Finish   If you are using a firewall software other than Windows Firewall, you should give permissions to the port number on that software. To activate the settings restart the computers. For using remote desktop connection, write down the computer name as IP:port number.  b) There is a problem with the remote desktop connection settings or the username The username that should be entered for the remote desktop connection may not be the same as the username when computer is turned on. If you are having trouble making a remote desktop connection to your computer, it is necessary to check that the username. To do this, the you should start the Task Manager (press "Ctrl + Alt + Delete" and choose "Start Task Manager" or press right click on the taskbar and choose "Start Task Manager") and check the username on the "Users" tab.   By establishing a remote connection you should use this username.  If there is a version difference with the remote desktop connection provided between the two computers (eg, trying to connect a Windows 7 computer from a Windows XP computer), you should choose "Allow connections from computers running any version of Remote Desktop (less secure)" from the remote desktop connection settings. You could access these settings from "Remote" tab in the "System Properties".

FAQ Question: What is eduroam? 
FAQ Answer:    METU eduroam wireless network, that was initiated by METU CC in October 2007, has been the first among Turkish universities to take part in the eduroam project (eduroam is an abbreviation for educational roaming) eduroam, working on RADIUS-based 802.1x security standard, aims seamless network usage of users of eduroam member institutions in other member educational institutions. The user of an eduroam member institution can use his/her username and password duo to connect to another member institution's eduroam wireless network. The user sends a request to the host institution, while the host institution's authentication server directs the connection request to the home institution's authentication server and the user is determined whether or not  to be authorized by the home authentication server. All these queries are sent back and forth between servers through an encrypted tunnel, hence the user name and password pair is visible only in the home server. The only thing user needs to do in this case, is to define the visitied institution eduroam wireless network like their institution's network.   
FAQ Link: https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/what-eduroam

FAQ Question: What is security level of eduroam?
FAQ Answer:   Today, the well known security technologies in wireless neotworking are WEP, WPA, WPA2. The security level of WEP and WPA are today very low level. For that reason our setup files come predefined with WPA2. But WPA-TKIP is temporarily in use.  
FAQ Link: https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/what-security-level-eduroam

FAQ Question: What is the technical structure of eduroam?
FAQ Answer:   In METU campus three (3) different brands of wireless access points are  used. These are Aruba, Cisco and HP Procurve.      As can be understood from the drawing, the infrasturcture in METU uses WPA2 security standard. Besides this security solution, TTLS (PAP) is used to autenticate users in an easy way. In this structure the user needs only a certificate for EAPP, user certicicate is not used. The requent coming to the RADIUS server constitutes a mutual tunnel and the information that comes through this tunnel is analyzed by RADIUS and queried to LDAP over the secure network. If LDAP authenticates the user's username and password, the system accepts the user.

FAQ Question: Why do I have to install a program for connecting eduroam?
FAQ Answer:   The most important issue in eduroam is the security issue. In classical wireless networks, it's possible that someone can listen to the communication data. The only way to prevent this is to increase the complexity of the encryption method. Starting from the first moment you send your username and password, the communication is provided with encryption. Since the program for starting this TTLS algorithm is not present in Windows operation systems, we have to use a different program. If you are running Windows 10, this algorithm is builtin and you do not need to install a program.

FAQ Question: How can I connect to INTERNET from dormitories?
FAQ Answer:   For the users who stay in the dormitories and want to use the local cable network, the first step is that the dormitory manager registers the user in the dormitory automation system. This process is conducted by the manager of the dormitories for each student during the registration to the dormitories. After the dormitory manager completes the registration, users have to sign in with their central system user name and password at https://netregister.metu.edu.tr Users can obtain access to the cable network after entering their MAC address information in Wired Network menu in netregister.metu.edu.tr Users stay in the summer time dormitories should be sure about their dormitory registration made for right dormitory. To do this, they can consult their dormitory manager or Directorate of Dormitories (2nd dormitory building) to get information. If users are not registered to any dormitory or their registration was made to wrong dormitory, they won't be able to make their own wired network registration on the netregister interface (https://netregister.metu.edu.tr/). Note: Since DHCP is used (i.e. recognized automatically) in all dormitories, the users in the dormitories can connect to the internet after completing all the steps defined above. They do not have to enter TCP/IP settings. Moreover, users who stay in those dormitories can also reach https://netregister.metu.edu.tr through local cable network before registration in order to complete their registration. Steps, in order to be connected to the internet after obtaining IP address information, are as follows: Be sure that your computer recognizes your Ethernet card. You can find it by clicking right to the computer icon, choosing properties, then device manager and network card. If your computer recognizes Ethernet card, that is, the right software is installed, you can continue without any problem. If there is an exclamation mark on the device icon, that means your computer does not recognize the Ethernet card. Then, you have to install the right software. Next step is the configuration of TCP/IP settings. Click right on the computer icon on the desktop, choose properties, then TCP/IP settings, and then choose properties. You can complete the settings by selecting "Obtain automatically"  in the relevant boxes and then clicking OK. Almost in all Windows operating systems, the configuration of TCP/IP settings is conducted similarly. Lastly, in order to connect to the cable network, it is necessary to obtain a UTP network cable from electronic stores.  You should measure the distance between the location of your computer and network plug. After connecting the UTP network cable to your computer and plug, you should be able to connect to METU cable network. It is suggested for the users who utilize network connection in the dormitory regions to read the Dormitory Rooms Computer Network Rules.      You can visit https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/how-can-i-find-out-about-source-my-network-connection-failure-dormitories if you have any problems connecting to the cable network.

FAQ Question: How is METU Wireless Network managed?
FAQ Answer:   METU Wireless Zones     
FAQ Link: https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/how-metu-wireless-network-managed

FAQ Question: Is there a wireless network in METU, how can I connect?
FAQ Answer:   History of Wireless Network in METU Middle East Technical University Computer Center has been the first to deploy wireless network among Turkish universities. This network was setup in point-to-point mode with 802.11b standard. Four distant departments / administrative units were connected using this method. A set of wireless connection equipment was set a side for emergency cases, in case the connection of a department might be damaged and there would be a need of immideate connection. This set was used a couple of times to connect the department/unit whose connection was damaged, to the backbone network temporarily until the connection is reestablihed conventioanlly. Later in year 2003, the first workgroup mode wireless network was established at the top of Central Engineering Building for enabling mobile clients' connectivity to Internet. The present of Wireless Network in METU In year 2005, with the increase in number of the wireless clients, the coverage area of the workgroup wireless network METU had been expanded to cover nearly the whole departments and administrative units. In every department and unit, hot spots for mobile users had been determined and these spots had been covered with wireless networks by setting up 802.11g access points. Now there is at least one wireless coverage area in every department and in addition to these, part of the dormitories, all academic residences, all the halls of the Library and the Cultural and Convention Center, and the guest houses are under coverage. To see the map of the wireless network points in METU you can take a look this map. There is currently at least one SSID broadcast in every AP (ng2k broadcast, which is available without any encryption, ended in 2018 and meturoam has started). There is also a second SSID broadcast (namely eduroam) from that runs with 802.1x and that's a part of the EDUROAM, which stands for Education Roaming. EDUROAM runs on a RADIUS-based infrastructure that uses 802.1X security technology to allow for inter-institutional roaming. For more information about this network and the details of how to set it, please go to eduroam page. Users without a wireless network interface card can borrow cards from the Library and Cultural and Convention Center with their ID cards. Unfortunately this service is available to METU students and personnel only. These cards are introduced to the authentication system beforehand and needn't to be registered. People visiting METU can use the wireless service at Cultural and Convention Centre and guest houses by registering their MAC addresses. This is going to be temporary registeration and will be deleted after a predetermined time.

FAQ Question: It seems I have a connection to the wireless network but I can't connect to the Internet. What should I do?
FAQ Answer:   Wireless network connection problems are observed in some of Android devices using Android 6 and prior versions. Occasionally these devices display there is an established wireless connection on the screen but when you try to connect to the Internet, they fail. This problem is originated from a bug in the operating system. The bug cause Android devices to continue to use DHCP-leased IP addresses after the leases expire, and cause Android devices to resume using IP addresses from expired DHCP leases. When you face the the same problem please disable your Wi-Fi connection and enable it again.

FAQ Question: My internet connection is very slow. What could be the problem?
FAQ Answer:   If your wireless internet connection is slow, you can review the following items; - Use of wrong modeled and outdated wireless ethernet card driver- Use of shields to cover the antennas of mobile devices or computers (especially metal ones)- Use of computer or device far away from the wireless access point (distance and intervening obstacles will reduce performance)- Having internet access in places with high user density (performance will decrease as the number of users on the wireless network access point increases). When using a wireless network, if possible, places with fewer users around can be preferred.- Unnecessary applications that make download/upload operations when using a wireless network (for example, downloading files while using Zoom)- Meturoam/Eduroam are virtual wireless network broadcasts and both are broadcast from physically the same wireless network devices. Some devices may experience problems because they use different crypto technologies. Alternatively, a connection can be attempted with the other.- Metuconnect is a network open for authorization only and does not provide an Internet connection. You can only reach netregister.metu.edu.tr via this network. After completing your authorization procedures, you need to stop using it by "forget this network". Staying connected to this network will cause you to experience Internet problems.- Staying between two similar broadcasts can cause connection problems, as mobile devices in wireless networks "roam" in a way that prefers the better one among the available broadcasts. Moving closer to one, if possible, will help eliminate these problems.- Current wifi technologies operate in the 2.4 and 5Ghz bands. 2.4Ghz performs much better in terms of wall throughput and distance. But considering the bandwidth and the number of users, 5Ghz works much better. If the features of your device are suitable, you can check which one you are connecting from. In some devices, one may be given priority or the device may be forced to use only one of them. In cases where you are close to a wireless network access device, providing a 5Ghz connection will increase performance. If you are far away from the device or there are walls in between, setting 2.4Ghz will provide a more stable connection. The slowness of your wired/wireless network connection speed may be due to any of the issues mentioned in the control items above. In addition, the connection speed may be slow due to the problem with your computer (problems with your network interface card, virus, etc.). When it is said "I have a problem with my internet speed", it is very important to define the problem correctly for a solution. Information such as the page trying to connect, the device used during the connection (operating system and MAC/IP address information), the connection time interval, the connected user code are very important for a quick solution. The address https://speedtest.metu.edu.tr/ can be used to detect the slowness of the connection speed and see the instant speed.

FAQ Question: How can I find out about the final status of the disk space and my quota I have used up?
FAQ Answer:   The disk space allocated for user account owners on the central servers is designated as quota. Two different quota areas are allocated for METU users and their capacities are independent from each other. While it is possible to find about the latest state of both quotas with the Horde service, it is only possible to find out about the latest status of the file quota with terminal software like SSH and others.  Displaying quota information with Horde Service:  First, you must enter the Horde system by https://horde.metu.edu.tr address, then you must select the File Manager option under the left menu bar's "My Account" title. You can see both the file quota and the e-mail quota information by pressing the Check Quota button. Due to E-mail Quota applications, when quota limits are exceded, incoming e-mails can not be delivered to the receiver and will be returned to the sender. So that, it is important to use e-mail quotas within the limits. Displaying file quota information with Shell Client Programs (SSH etc.):  Connect to your user account by using a terminal program like SSH and write the command    quota on the command line. Click Enter to view the status of your file quota. The following screen will be displayed:   On this screen, you will see the following terms;  blocks indicates the space you take up on your file quota in kilobytes, quota indicates the limit of your file quota in kilobytes, limit indicates the maximum amount that your file quota could get hold of in kilobytes, grace indicates the time that has remained from your grace period, files indicates the number of files available on your file quota.

FAQ Question: I am over quota, what should I do?
FAQ Answer:   The disk space allocated for user account owners on the central servers is designated as quota. Two different quota areas are allocated for METU users, one for their files and one for their e-mail. The procedures to be followed are different when file or e-mail message quotas are full. For the e-mail messages quota: Another quota is designated for the disk area where the user keeps the e-mail messages. When 90% of this quota is full, an alert message is sent to the user. Due to E-mail Quota applications, when quota limits are exceded, incoming e-mails can not be delivered to the receiver and will be returned to the sender. So that, it is important to use e-mail quotas within the limits. When the e-mail messages quota is exceeded or near the upper limit, measures such as; deleting unnecessary and bulky e-mail messages, keeping the e-mail message attachments on the hard disk of the computer being used may be taken and the overload on the quota can be reduced. For the file quota: "quota exceeded" message tells you that, at present, you are using all of the disc space that is granted to you for the files on the server systems. Currently, the procedure allows a file quota of 100 MB to students and 250 MB to the personnel. You can display your disk usage and file quota with command quota If you draw near to your limit value, you may not be able to access to your account. Remember that Blocks value should not be higher than the Limit value. Otherwise you will receive "quota exceed" message. When you exceed the quota limits, the first thing you have to do is to find out the files with the largest sizes. You should either zip them or delete the unnecessary ones. Enter the following commands, to see the spaces used by each of your file; ls -l ls -l |more to zip your files;  gzip  to open the files that you have zipped;gunzip To change the directory you are in, enter this command;cd <directory_name> to delete file(s) you can refer to this page

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR VULNERABILITY Recently discovered that a potential security vulnerability is found in Mathematica 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3 on Linux operating systems. Under certain circumstances, users of your system could execute arbitrary Wolfram Language code as root. Recent versions of Wolfram systems containing VernierLink were shipped with a vulnerability potentially allowing non-root users to run arbitrary commands as root. This only affects machines where the Wolfram System was installed as root. We therefore strongly recommend you apply the following steps to all Linux systems on which any of these Wolfram System versions are installed. Resolution: If you do not use or plan to use the VernierLink functionality in Mathematica, remove the vulnerable file:  sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/wolfram-vernierlink-libusb.rules  You may be prompted to provide admin-level credentials to complete this action. If you are connecting Mathematica to Vernier-branded external devices using VernierLink, adjust the permissions of this file:  sudo chmod 644 /etc/udev/rules.d/wolfram-vernierlink-libusb.rules  You may be prompted to provide admin-level credentials to complete this action.

In the first stage, as stated in the announcement, required members benefiting from Office 365 services to individually back up/delete all their data on OneDrive, Teams, and other Microsoft services.  The second stage, to be carried out between June 24 and July 1, 2024, involves discontinuing the Office 365 A1 Plus licenses used in our university and providing access to new licenses through a new infrastructure.  As part of the second stage, there will be planned restrictions on access to existing Microsoft services during the specified dates. Disruptions may occur when logging into Microsoft Teams, Office 365 software, and other Microsoft services. After the stage is completed on July 1, 2024, all our members will be able to access Microsoft services via their new "@metu.edu.tr" email addresses (e.g., for staff: namesurname@metu.edu.tr // for students: e123456@metu.edu.tr) and new access passwords, which they will obtain by following the "Forgot my password" steps, through the new infrastructure.  After the transition to the new infrastructure, it will not be possible to access data in the old infrastructure using the "@metu.edu.tr" Microsoft accounts and new access passwords. Members wishing to access their data in the old infrastructure will be able to log into Microsoft services with temporarily created "@metu2.metu.edu.tr" email addresses (e.g., for staff: namesurname@metu2.metu.edu.tr // for students: e123456@metu2.metu.edu.tr) and their old Microsoft account passwords.

FAQ Question: I cannot send a message from my METU account to an external e-mail address which has been directed to an address in METU. Why?
FAQ Answer:   E-mail messages sent from a usermetu.edu.tr structured e-mail address to an e-mail address with the same structure; in other words, e-mail messages with "usermetu.edu.tr" for both the "To:" and "From:" fields (the sender and the recipient are the same) are blocked unless they are sent via "mail.metu.edu.tr" server. This procedure is applied in order to block the unwanted messages from out of campus sources, like fake and/or spam messages, to be distributed. For this reason, when you direct the e-mail account provided by an email service provider from outside of METU to the e-mail address with the METU central user code, e-mail messages sent from an account with a METU field name will be classified as fake/spam e-mail and blocked by the central servers since it will be conveyed through a server which is out of campus. Important: Directing from departmental e-mail accounts (e.g. xxxxx.metu.edu.tr) is not within the scope and therefore is not blocked.

FAQ Answer:   Sunucu sistemlerimiz e-posta alışverişinde Türkçe karakterleri desteklemektedir. Horde ve Squirrelmail arayüzlerine Türkçe olarak girildiğinde gönderilen e-postaların karakter seti ISO-8859-9, İngilizce olarak girildiğinde ise UTF-8'dir. Her iki karakter seti de Türkçe karakterleri içermektedir. UTF-8’de Türkçe dışındaki kimi dillere özel karakterler de bulunmaktadır. Not: Horde arayüzünde e-posta gönderirken "Karakter Seti" alanındaki seçenekleri kullanarak bu ayarı değiştirmek mümkündür. Horde ya da Squirrelmail arayüzü dışında Outlook Express, Thunderbird ya da Windows Mail benzeri herhangi bir POP3/IMAP istemcisi ile e-posta gönderiyorsanız gönderilen e-postanın karakter seti, ilgili programın kendi ayarlarına bağlı olarak belirlenir. Giden e-postalar için karakter seti değişikliği yapmak için farklı programlarda izlenen yol aşağıdaki gibidir (aşağıda yer almayan farklı programlar için de karakter seti ayarları benzer yerlerdedir): Outlook Express ve Windows Mail için: Tools → Options → Send → International Settings (Araçlar → Seçenekler → Gönder → Uluslararası Ayarlar) Mozilla Thunderbird için: Tools → Options → Display → Fonts → Character Encodings (Araçlar → Seçenekler → Görünüm → Yazıtipleri → Karakter Kodlaması) Göndereceğiniz e-postada Türkçe karakter kullanmak istiyorsanız söz konusu menülerdeki ayarları ISO-8859-9 (Türkçe ISO olarak da tanımlanır) ya da UTF-8 seçmeniz yeterlidir. Size gelen e-postalardaki Türkçe karakterleri görmekte sorun yaşıyorsanız iki farklı durum sözkonusu olabilir. Karşı taraf e-posta gönderirken ya da kendisine gelen e-postayı yönlerken Türkçe karakterleri desteklemeyen bir karakter seti kullanmıştır. Bu durumda gelen mesaj düzgün olarak görüntülenemez. Örneğin metinde Türkçe karakter kullanıldığı halde gönderilirken ISO-8859-1 karakter seti kullanılmış ise söz konusu karakter seti Türkçe karakterleri desteklemediği için e-postanın düzgün olarak görüntülenmesi mümkün değildir. Gönderilen e-posta düzgün karakter seti ile gönderilmiş olmasına karşın kullandığınız programın ayarları farklı olabilir. Bu durumda kullanılan programın ayarlarının değiştirilmesi mesajın düzgün şekilde okunmasını sağlayacaktır. Horde ya da Squirrelmail kullanarak e-posta okuyan kullanıcılarımızın kullandıkları tarayıcı programında, Outlook Express, Thunderbird ya da Windows Mail benzeri herhangi bir POP3/IMAP istemcisi ile e-posta gönderen kullanıcılarımızın ise ilgili programdaki karakter seti ayarlarını değiştirmeleri gerekmektedir. Gelen e-postalar için karakter seti değişikliği yapmak için farklı programlarda izlenen yol aşağıdaki gibidir (aşağıda yer almayan farklı programlar için de karakter seti ayarları benzer yerlerdedir): Internet Explorer, Outlook Express ve Windows Mail için: View → Encoding (Görünüm → Kodlama) Mozilla Firefox ve Mozilla Thunderbird için: View → Character Encoding (Göster → Karakter Kodlaması)

FAQ Question: What is the difference between POP3 and IMAP accounts?
FAQ Answer:   POP and IMAP are communication protocols that download your e-mails to your personal computer or other devices. POP3It provides basic downloading and deleting actions. E-mail service providers who use POP usually take actions as follows; connect to the server, get all the messages, keep those messages on the user’s device and delete them from the server, disconnect to server. Therefore, when mails are also deleted from the device, they are no longer available. However, some e-mail service providers may provide an option to archive those messages in a new folder. POP3 supports only one user at a time. In fact, if you connect to your account from a second device then it disconnects the first one. IMAPWhen several devices are connected to a mail service provider at the same time, IMAP protocol prevent some possible problems with these devices to occur. Unlikely to POP, IMAP provides bidirectional communication.

About Cisco Webex Webex is an optimal solution for smartworking and distance learning.This document takes into account two main scenarios that are addressed by specific Webex applications for each scenario: Distance lesson (virtual class)Focus on real-time collaboration between teacher and students with audio/video, application sharing, multimedia content, annotation and polls: Webex Meetings.In this scenario, students can join the lesson in guest mode, that is, without having to create a Webex account. Collaboration between teachers and staff of the School InstituteAdvanced document chat and sharing capabilities in a more structured environment in addition to audio/video collaboration and screen sharing: Webex Teams. Description of the setup process (preliminary) TeacherThe teacher receives the welcome email -> click to set the password and install the Webex Meetings appStudentThe student installs Cisco Webex Meetings on their iPad/tablet/mobile device without having to create a Webex account Setup for the teacher  Click "activate" in the welcome emailThe browser opens, allowing the teacher to enforce their password The Webex page loads in the browser Click "Download" to download the Webex Meetings App and install it Teacher login Launch the Webex Meetings app on your PC and log in using your Webex credentials (email address and password) Virtual lesson The virtual lesson takes place in a virtual classroom represented by the so-called "Personal Room" or personal room of the teacher.This room represents the physical class of the school and the Personal Room provides digital tools that allow an advanced collaboration between teacher and students. Teachers can share their PC screen, show documents, applications, and even multimedia content.The Personal Room is run by the teacher. The teacher initiates the lesson by allowing the students to participate. The teacher can also mute or even expel one or more students and can record the lesson itself, to allow students who are absent to enjoy it later. The teacher can lock (equivalent to locking the classroom door) to prevent other students from connecting and finally, it is always the teacher who has the power to finish the lesson, closing the Personal Room. How to use: The professor organizes the video conference for the class using the link to WebexThe professor copies the Webex link of his/her Personal Room from the Webex appThe professor shares the link with the class through the most appropriate tool (electronic register, email etc)At the indicated time, the professor starts the meeting; students participate by clicking on the received linkStudents who connect in advance (before the professor starts the meeting) are waiting. They are equally waiting when the professor locks the meeting.

As long as no student has connected Webex shows the white screen, with the teacher's video at the bottom of the page. Student Participation Premise: The student installed the Webex Meetings app and received, by email for example, the link to the lesson (link of the Personal Room) Clicking on the link launches the Webex appThe student enters their first and last name and an email address -> click on "join meeting"(note: Webex account is not required, so no password is needed, and the email is purely informative) The preview starts -> click "Join" to enter the virtual class Note: With a non-standard browser, you may need to open the Webex Meetings app and insert the link to the lesson. Lesson control (for the teacher) The teacher can, through the list of participants, mute and possibly even expel the students individually.  In addition, the teacher can turn off the camera during the lesson, share content, read what is written on chat screen, write a reply, survey (polling), share screen or application. The teacher can, at any time, block access to the Personal Room by preventing additional participants (e.g. students of a different class) from entering. In the same way, the teacher can unlock it at any time.  Only the teacher can finish the lesson. The teacher is also entitled to leave the Personal Room without the lecture ending, but in this case he will have to indicate another participant to take the lead on his/her behalf. You can e-mail to odtuclass@metu.edu.tr for your questions and issues about Cisco Webex.

FAQ Question: Where can I find information about ReCaptcha image validation (I'm not a robot) on the registration page?
FAQ Answer:   Google ReCaptcha service is added to the user's browser automatically and verified by Google. In addition, since this service has a timeout, the verification may time out by itself when the correct ones are selected from the images shown on the screen and waiting for a while. In addition to these, accesses from different IP addresses, some extension used in the browser, opening many pages in the incognito tab, wrong selections in the images provided by the ReCaptcha service may cause more information to be requested and verification images to be shown in order to prove that you are not a robot in subsequent verifications. You can experience how the Google ReCaptcha service works outside the registration page by accessing https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo?invisible=false and experience the image verification service that will appear on the screen by opening the same address in an incognito tab. In some cases, there are inconsistencies between the information requested by the ReCaptcha verification service and the images displayed on the screen. For example, when the service requests you to select a fire hydrant in verification, there may not be a fire hydrant in the pictures shown. In such a case, it is necessary to proceed to the next verification by clicking skip. We do not interfere with the Google ReCaptcha verification service used on our registration page.

FAQ Question: What can I do to make my Apple MAC computer more secure?
FAQ Answer:   APPLE MAC SECURITY PRECAUTIONS Your Apple MAC computer can get the threats from two sources: 1. The Internet 2. Direct Access / Physical Access (if you leave your computer unattended or without taking the necessary precautions) What can you do to increase your MAC’s security features? Basically, you will do all the configuration by clicking the Apple icon on the left top corner and choosing the System Preferences option.  1. Using a standard user: When setting up a new operating system, the user that is defined is an administrator type user. Admin users are entitled to make any changes on the computer. It’s a safer practice to use your computer with standard user rather than an administrative user. (Apple>System Preferences> User and Groups option you can change the user type to standard and renew the password.)  2. Secure Password Policy: Do not choose your password from easily guessable passwords like your name, birthday, phone number or from ones that can be obtained from dictionary or brute force attacks. Secure password policy can be summarized in its simplest form as: A phrase containing at least 8 characters including uppercase, lower case letters, special characters (!, #, $, +, &) and digits.  3. Disable Automatic login Option: Disable automatic login option (login without entering a password to the computer).  (Apple > System Preferences > User and Groups >  Login Options; choose automatic login off).  4. Uninstall Flash Player Flash Player is a software that can contain many security vulnerabilities. If you do not use the software at all, just uninstall it. If you do use it, then set it to make updates automatically. (Apple > System Preferences)  5. Use a Password Manager: In the world of today, we use many different passwords for various purposes and of course we have to remember them. We would again like to remind you about the password policy in number 2. Besides, instead of keeping all the passwords in your memory, you can keep only one password in mind which is the password manager program’s password and keep the all the other passwords in the manager program safely. (Programs like Key Chain, 1 Password, Keeper that you can download from App Store) 6. Encrypt the files in your disk with File Vault: If there are valuable files on your MAC computer, you can encrypt your files towards unwanted access. (Apple > System Preferences > Security&Privacy > FileVault tab and turn it on.)  7. Review your Spotlight Permissions: Spotlight forwards your searches to Apple and Apple can share your information to third party partners. If you would like your search information to remain private, review your Spotlight options. (Apple > System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy tab, you can define exceptions for your information not be forwarded.  8. Location Services Inspect your applications that you share your location services with, and disable the ones that are unnecessary. (Apple > System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy tab) Do not forget that the “Find My MAC” application works with location services; and if your MAC is lost or stolen you will be able find your device with the help of this feature. It’s a better idea to use location services with appropriate permissions.   9. Software Updates Follow the software updates frequently, and even set it to an automatic version. (Apple > System Preferences > App Store tab there is an option to automatically download and set up the updates).  10. Use Your Screen Saver Efficiently Do not leave your computer unattended. For securing the computer and the data on it, define a screensaver that will activate after a short time the computer stays idle and will be disabled only by entering your password. (Apple > System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver). 11. Activate your Firewall Activate your firewall and enable it in stateful mode, which means, no one will be able to make a connection to your computer unless you start the connection. (Apple > System Preferences > Security&Privacy > Firewall tab; activate with Firewall on; click Firewall options > Block all incoming connections option will enable your firewall to become a stateful firewall.)   12. Sharing Control your Sharing. Avoid unnecessary sharing and disable them. (Apple > System Preferences > Sharing) Use this tab to control each service and disable the ones that are unnecessarily enabled.   13. Define a Firmware Password: You are encrypting the data on your computer with FileVault but this still does not guarantee a malicious person to boot your computer with a USB stick and erase all the data or install operating system from scratch, in case your computer is stolen or lost. When you define a firmware password, unlike in the case of PCs, firmware password will be asked only if you try to boot the system with unconventional ways. To define firmware password: When booting up the computer, press Cmd+R when the Apple logo appears; then on the screen that appears select Utilitiesà Firmware Password Utility. Please be careful defining this password, since if you forget it, you may need to visit the Apple Authorized Service. 14. Two Step Authentication If you define two step authentication on your MAC, you will add an additional layer of security. (The second step is a verification code that comes to your telephone) You can find information on Apple’s web page about two step authentication. 15. Guest User Defining a guest user: If you have enabled FileVault, you can use guest user and login the computer without password; use just Safari and all the data generated through the guest login is erased after the user logs out. Enabling the guest user on the computer enables the computer to be relocated after it’s lost or stolen. (Apple > System Preferences > User & Groups option).  16. Find My MAC! Activate Find My MAC to relocate your computer if it is stolen or lost. (Apple > System Preferences > iCloud > Find My MAC must be selected.) 17. Third Party Antivirus Software You can use third party antivirus software to determine malicious code on your MAC. For example, you can use the free version of BitDefender (Can we downloaded from App Store). 18. Use VPN If you utilize open wireless networks a lot (like airports, coffee shops, libraries etc) you can take advantage of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to secure your traffic over the Internet. (Apple > System Preferences > Network, in the box on the left side, click “+” to set up VPN service.) METU offers a VPN service to the users but through this service you can access only local services and network of METU. Visit page https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/how-can-i-use-metu-vpn-service-mac-os-x-installed-devices to setup VPN service of METU.  19. Use Legal Software Do not install illegal software. Do not use Warez. If you use software from Warez, you enable unwanted, malicious codes on your computer. To increase your security, install software only from App Store or identified developers. (Apple > System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General tab, choose Allow apps downloaded in a secure way). 20. Backup Your Data You should always backup your valuable data against theft, loss, physical damage on disc etc. (Apple > System Preferences > Time Machine).  21. use eduroam SSID for wireless in METU There are 2 SSIDs for wireless network in METU Campus, eduroam and ng2k. ng2k is an open wireless network that works with MAC address authentication. On the other hand eduroam is secure wireless network working on RADIUS based 8021.x security standard. Furthermore if you setup eduroam on your device, you can wireless network in any institution that is a member of the eduroam infrastructure. You can visit http://eduroam.metu.edu.tr to get information about setting up eduroam SSID on your computer.

FAQ Question: What is phishing?
FAQ Answer: Phishing, an expression derived from "password fishing", is an illegal way of collecting personal information such as passwords, bank or credit card account details etc. by sending misleading and fraudulent e-mails. Due to security reasons, METU-CC never sends any e-mails for the need to update user information such as account name, password etc. How to discover phishing It is technically possible to arrange the "From" line in a manner to mislead users on an e-mail. It is crucial not to open address links on e-mail messages demanding your personal information updates or other similar topics. Never click on the link addresses given in the e-mail that asks you to update your personal information like credit card details, passwords etc. Due to security reasons, establishments that provide services on the internet such as banks, brokerage houses, internet service providers etc. never send their user info update requirements by e-mail. Upon receiving such e-mail, contact the related corporate and confirm whether the contents of the e-mail you received are actually valid. Lately there has been observed an increase in the number of e-mail sent to mislead users and get their personal information. As time progresses it becomes harder and harder to detect such bogus e-mails. Therefore, in case of doubt, be sure whether the e-mail has been sent specifically to you or not. Check the "To" section if there is only your e-mail address written or the message is sent under a general user name as a bulk. If the e-mail has not been sent specifically to you and the content is suspicious, you can regard that message as fake or spam. Suspicious contents can be as follows: Looking for candidates to work for high pay. I'm the son of the richest tribes chief of Africa, have inherited a large sum, could you help out? Congratulations, you've earned the biggest prize, click on the link to accept. The fake web pages given on the bogus e-mails have some various characteristics in common.  Generally the pictures are low quality. When you check the address line, you can observe that the connection made is not to the web page intended but to some other address or maybe directly to an IP number. Some bogus e-mails are also sent to collect e-mail addresses. Avoid e-mail messages with instructions like "click on the attached file in order to ...". Do not click on message lines like "if you do not wish to receive similar e-mails click here to unsubscribe" in order not to be flooded with spam e-mail. There are also some e-mail messages that can be for real, but most probably may be bogus, which arouse attention of users with their social content. Such e-mails cause loss of time and resources. Topics like charity donation, help for an ill child or the need for a wheel chair, the need of the e-mail to be forwarded to as many people as you can etc. are all examples of bogus e-mail.

FAQ Question: What is Time Stamp, why is it have to be used? (In Turkish)
FAQ Answer:   English version will be available soon. Zaman damgası nedir? Zaman damgası, elektronik ortamda log, doküman ve sözleşme gibi elektronik verilerin, belirli bir zamandan önce var olduğunu kanıtlamak için kullanılır. Mesela bir log dosyasının, kayıt altına alındıgı tarihte orjinal haliyle var oldugunu, sonradan değiştirilmediğini ispatlamak amacıyla zaman damgasından yararlanılabilir. Niçin Kullanılması Gerekmektedir? 30 Kasım 2007 tarih ve 26716 sayılı Resmi Gazete'de yayınlanan "İnternet Ortamında Yapılan Yayınların Düzenlenmesine Dair Usul Ve Esaslar Hakkında Yönetmelik" gereğince yer sağlayıcılar, "Yer sağlayıcı trafik bilgisini altı ay saklamakla, bu bilgilerin doğruluğunu, bütünlüğünü oluşan verilerin dosya bütünlük değerlerini zaman damgası ile birlikte saklamak ve gizliliğini temin etmekle" yükümlüdürler. Bu kapsamda, mesela bir web sayfası bulunduran sunucunun trafik bilgisi loglarının kanunen zaman damgası ile damgalanması zorunludur. Log Bilgileri Nasıl Zaman damgası ile damgalanır? Aşağıdaki çizim, bir log dosyasının üretildiği tarihten sonra değistirilmediğini gösteren zaman damgası ile damgalama yöntemlerinden birisidir. Bu yöntemle, ileriki bir tarihte oluşturulan zaman dosyasının değiştirilmediğini göstermek için benzer işlemin tekrarı yapılır, sonuç özet (hash) değerleri aynı bulunursa, dosyanın orjinal, zaman damgalandığı tarihten itibaren değişmediği sonucu çıkar.

FAQ Question: Can I use my certificate in international correspondence?
FAQ Answer:   There are a number of verifications for transactions made with electronic signatures. Just one of these; verification of the authority issuing the certificate and ensuring the accuracy of the certificate (root certificate) of this authority. In this regard, the "Regulation on Procedures and Principles Regarding the Implementation of Electronic Signature Law" contains the following information about Foreign Electronic Service Providers (ECSP): - Conditions regarding the legal consequences and acceptance of foreign electronic certificates are determined by international agreements. - For end-user certificates to be used in different countries, the two countries need to sign an agreement by making a joint decision, and then, technical studies should be carried out with some methods to ensure that the root certificates of the countries trust each other.  - Both countries must be working within the framework of international standards (such as ETSI TS 101 733, ETSI TS 101 903, CWA 14710 etc.). For this reason, it is not possible to use the certificates obtained in EU member countries and other countries immediately. For this job, the two countries need to come together and make an agreement by making the necessary investigations and studies.

FAQ Question: What is Spyware?
FAQ Answer:   Spyware is the name given to software that collects computer users' personal information without the users' willing or knowledge. Other terminology such as "malware" and "adware" which have a general and different meaning may also be used instead of spyware. Spyware can perform various actions, such as keeping track of the keyboard when typing, keeping a record of the visited web sites, scanning the data on the hard disk, tracking the searches performed on the internet etc. which all mean a breach of secrecy of personal information. As a result, it can get hold of the passwords of e-mail, bank account etc. illegally, display pop-up windows and/or send spam e-mails for "personal advertisements" which are annoying, use up network and computer resources which causes the computer slow down, lag in opening up web pages, longer boot and action durations in general. Spyware software are different from viruses, since they are not openly illegal and not designed for purposes that would directly pose a threat to the user, and install themselves onto the computer with the user_x0092_s consent or activities. Furthermore spyware do not copy themselves from one computer to another, like viruses do. However, the consent is obtained without any clarifying explanation on how these malicious software will work and perform on the computer. Usually the user receives a notice asking to install an annex (add-on, extension, plug-in) on the web browser in order to open up or display the web page properly, and upon giving the authorization the spyware is installed. Also a web site that provides a free service (software, music, video, online games etc.) may impose the software to be installed on the computer. Similarly, some free software install spyware secretly or by trying to get the consent of the user while installing their software. Such sites or software developers sell and thus obtain a gain for having the software installed by selling the users_x0092_ personal or statistical information to people or groups who aim to advertise etc.

FAQ Question: What should I do after removing the virus from my computer?

FAQ Question: What should I do to protect my computer against spyware?
FAQ Answer:   The most effective way of avoiding such software is to refrain from certain user habits that cause these to spread. Authorizing all the inquiry or notice windows while surfing the internet leads to the installation of many unnecessary software. People who have higher expertise and experience stay away from problems without making use of anti-spyware software. Therefore it is imperative that a dialogue or a notice screen encountered on any web page not be authorized without really understanding what is wanted or without consulting someone who might have an insight. In addition, some free software such as internet accelerator, rapid download, file sharing etc. install spyware along with their functionality. Even more, there are spyware installed on computers that claim that they themselves are anti- spyware and that they will clean up the malicious software in the computer thus deceiving the unknowing user. Before installing any such free software, you should search on the internet about them or consult for technical support from experts. Anti-spyware Anti-spyware are security software developed to protect computers from spyware. Some anti-virus software are capable of protecting the computer against well-known spyware, however, anti-spyware have specialized on removing, deleting or making obsolete the spyware and updating themselves for newly developed spyware.

This product automatically updates itself, recognizes spyware and blocks them from appending themselves to the system, furthermore scans and eradicates those that have already been added. You have to activate it from Windows Security settings, by clicking "Actions Recommended"

FAQ Question: What should I do to protect my computer against viruses?
FAQ Answer:   Install a licensed antivirus program such as Symantec, Norton, McAfee etc. and always keep it updated. An antivirus program that has not been updated is helpless against newly devised viruses. Keep your operating system updated. You can update your Windows operating system from Settings -> Windows Update. Instead of Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express, prefer to use Mozilla Thunderbird or any of the webmail services provided by METU-Mail since these are more reliable against viruses that seep through gaps in Microsoft Outlook ve Outlook Express. Unless necessary do not turn on file sharing. If it is a must, set password requirement on and select read-only file sharing. Unless needed, do not set up server type operating systems such as Microsoft Windows Server etc. Do not operate IIS (Internet Information Services) as a web server that have not been updated. Set your computer to be booted only from the hard disk. Always back up your crucial files/information. Do not run macros on the office programs that you do not know. For not to be affected of viruses which infect through Microsoft Office, use alternative Office programs such as OpenOffice.org. Do not run the executable files which have been sent by e-mail as attachment unless you verify it from the sender. Use anti-spyware to protect your computer against spyware which aims to collect your personal information.

FAQ Question: What is SPAMBOX?
FAQ Answer:   The received e-mail messages are filtered by a spam filter which is running on central mail server. The messages that are marked as spam are directed to a folder located under your mail directory, and it is named as SPAMBOX. You can access the SPAMBOX through Horde, SquirrelMail or pine programs; or e-mail clients using IMAP services. Sometimes a normal e-mail can be marked as spam by the filter. Therefore you should check your SPAMBOX periodically.

FAQ Question: What measures does the CC take regarding spam/bogus e-mail?
FAQ Answer:   The messages that arrive at the CC mail server are categorized into spam which are directed to the SPAMBOX folder of the users, some are identified as containing a virus and automatically discarded, the actual messages that do not contain a virus or are not classified as spam are placed at the INBOX folders of the users. Spam messages are filtered by the CC, by means of the spam filter operating on the e-mail server. E-mail identified as spam by this filter is directed to a specific e-mail box, referred to as SPAMBOX, located within the main mail folder of the recipient. The main reason for sending spam messages to the SPAMBOX rather than deleting them is to give our users a chance to check if the identification was correct and not to lose a message that has mistakenly been identified as spam and sent to the SPAMBOX. The spam filter software is dynamic and is able to increase its success rate by learning from our users when identifying a message as spam or an actual e-mail message. In the learning process, thanks to the frequency of number of words used, sender address, and other such header information, used in e-mail messages defined as clean or spam, the spam filter software decides on the probability of an incoming e-mail to be spam and marks those with a certain threshold level as spam. Then, these e-mail messages are carried on to SPAMBOXes. Theoretically, it is possible for this filter to identify messages correctly with 99.9 % accuracy. When the filter is constantly fed with clean/spam messages, its success rate increases. The expert staff at the CC, after much research done, have decided this filter system to be the best solution for METU users, and after meticulous teaching work on defining clean/spam messages to the filter, they have put the system into application. The software is at a process of constant learning due to its technical structure and renews itself according to the customer profile.

FAQ Question: How can I apply for a new e-list?
FAQ Answer:   To create a new list on the list server of METU, the academic/administrative department or the adviser/administrator of the student group must apply to METU Computer Center by filling out the "Application Form". A user code and a password defined on the central servers of the university are required to access the application form. The list owner will be notified, if the request to open a new list is deemed appropriate by the Center. A user must fill out the "Application Form" to be able to open the list she/he wants. The information required on this form covers explanation about the list, the aim of the list, the owner of the list and the type of the list. Only the academic and administrative personnel can access the form using their usernames and passwords defined on the central servers. The procedure for opening a list on METU Electronic List Server is handled by CC Informatics Group. The name of the list is required to be relevant to the aim and the subject of the list. In addition generic names and names which can possibly be used as user names should not be entered as list names. In case of such list name requests CC Informatics Group suggests appending an "-l" at the end of the list name or adding another suitable suffix or prefix. eg: If the user requests the list name "cinema", it is suggested that the name may be changed as odtu-cinema or cinema-l. Moreover, communication lists are requested for some courses during the academic term. In the applications made for these courses, list name is required to be a combination of the related department's ECS user code and the course code. If a list is requested for a course which is given in more than one section, the list name is defined by adding the section number to the name of the list for the course: Eg: econ123id234-2 For the requests from METU Northern Cyprus Campus, list name must start with "ncc-" in addition to the criteria above. Departments may own electronic lists for the purpose of communicating with their students, in case list administration is handled by their own personnel. Names of such lists that can be defined for different classes are as below: 1. class -> dept-freshman 2. class -> dept-sophomore 3. class -> dept-junior 4. class -> dept-senior Master and Doctorate Students -> dept-graduate or dept-gAll Undergraduate Students -> dept-undergraduate or dept-ug Similarly, if requested by departments, general lists with the names, dept-students, dept-staff and dept-faculty can be defined for respectively the department students, staff or faculty members."dept" is replaced with the ECS user code of the department.

FAQ Question: How can I define a common password for the electronic lists I have subscribed? (in Turkish)
FAQ Answer:   E-liste servisindeki altyapı gereği, kullanıcıların üye oldukları her bir e-liste için farklı e-liste şifreleri tanımlanmaktadır. Dileyen kullanıcılarımız kolaylık olması açısından, tüm e-listeler için ortak bir e-liste şifresi tanımlayabilirler. Bunun için aşağıdaki işlemlerin yapılması gerekmektedir. Not: Güvenlik önlemi olarak, merkezi kullanıcı kodları için kullanılan şifrelerin e-liste şifresi olarak kullanılmaması önerilmektedir. Bir kullanıcı öncelikle üye olduğu herhangi bir listeye gönderilmiş bir mesajın sonunda yer alan e-liste web arayüzü bağlantısını kullanarak o e-listenin ayarları ile ilgili değişikliklerin yapılabildiği sayfaya (http://mailman.metu.edu.tr/mailman/listinfo/liste_adi) girmelidir.  Bu sayfanın en alt bölümünde yer alan e-posta adresi bölümüne, bu e-listeye üye olmak için kullandığı e-posta adresini yazarak, _x0093_Listeden çık veya seçeneklerimi düzenle_x0094_ isimli butona tıklamalıdır.  Eğer e-liste şifresi daha önceden girilmiş ise, aşağıdaki şekilde olduğu gibi e-liste üyelik ayarlarının değiştirilebildiği ekran görünecektir. Aksi durumda, e-liste şifresi kullanılarak giriş yapılmalıdır:  Üye olduğu tüm e-listelere yönelik ortak bir şifre tanımlamak isteyen kullanıcı bu sayfada yer alan _x0093_Şifre Değişimi_x0094_ bölümüne mevcut e-liste şifresini veya kullanmak istediği herhangi bir şifreyi yazıp, _x0093_Şifremi Değiştir_x0094_ butonuna _x0093_Global Olarak Değiştir_x0094_ seçeneği seçili olacak şekilde tıklamalıdır.  Bu işlem başarılı bir şekilde gerçekleştirildiği takdirde, ekranda _x0093_Şifre başarıyla değiştirildi._x0094_ şeklinde bir mesaj görüntülenir. Kullanıcı tarafından tanımlanan yeni şifre artık aynı e-posta adresi ile üye olunan mevcut tüm e-listelerde kullanılabilir. Şifre değiştirme işlemi sırasında _x0093_Global Olarak Değiştir_x0094_ seçeneği seçili olmadığı durumda, sadece söz konusu e-listenin şifresi değiştirilmiş olur. "Global Olarak Değiştir" seçeneği ile kullanıcının o ana kadar üye olduğu tüm listelerin şifreleri değiştirilir. Bu işlem sonrasında üye olunacak yeni e-listelerde de aynı şifrenin kullanılabilmesi için bu işlemin her üyelikten sonra tekrarlanması gerekir. Bu işlem yapılmadığında yeni üye olunan e-listelerde, üye olurken Mailman tarafından otomatik olarak tanımlanıp kullanıcıya gönderilen şifreler kullanılır.

FAQ Question: I am member of "abc-l" list but the messages I send does not arrive to the list. What may be the problem? (in Turkish)
FAQ Answer:   Eğer söz konusu liste "tek yönlü duyuru listesi" ise, liste yapılandırması gereği e-posta gönderme yetkisine sahip kişiler haricinde hiç bir kullanıcı mesaj gönderememektedir. Ancak üyelerin e-posta gönderebildiği bir liste söz konusu ise, gönderdiginiz mesajlarin listeye ulaşmamasının iki temel sebebi vardır: Listeye üyelik için kullanmadığıniz bir e-posta adresinden mesaj gönderiyor olabilirsiniz. Genelde birden fazla e-posta adresi kullanıyorsanız ve üye olan adresten farklı bir adrese yönlendirme tanımladıysanız, liste mesajlarini aldığınız e-posta adresi ile üyelik için kullandığınız e-posta adresi farklı olabilir. Mesajları aldığınız e-posta adresinin listeye üye olarak kayıtlı olup olmadığını kontrol etmesi için abc-l-ownermetu.edu.tr adresinden liste yöneticisiyle iletişime geçiniz. Listeye üyelik için kullandığınız e-posta adresinden mesaj gönderiyorsanız mesajiniz onay bekliyor olabilir. Mesajinızın onay için bekletiliyor olmasının olası sebepleri aşağıda listelenmiştir: Gönderdiğiniz mesaj liste mesaj kotasını aşan bir büyüklüğe sahip olabilir (örneğin; çok büyük bir dosya eklentisi gönderiyor olabilirsiniz). Mesajınızın alıcı adresi bölümünde liste adıyla beraber çok sayıda e-posta adresini yazmış olabilirsiniz. Mesajiniz liste ayarları gereği moderatör onayı için bekletiliyor olabilir. Tüm bu olası sebeplerle ilgili olarak abc-l-ownermetu.edu.tr adresinden liste yöneticisi ile iletişime geçebilir, detaylı bilgi alabilirsiniz.  (Yukarıda geçen "abc-l" ifadesi liste ismi için örnek olarak verilmiştir)

FAQ Question: I am the administrator of  "abc-l" list. I do not remember the list admin password. How can I get it? (in  Turkish)
FAQ Answer:   Liste yönetim şifresini edinmek için listenin yöneticisi olarak kullandığınız e-posta adresinden mailman@metu.edu.tr adresine yöneticisi olduğunuz listenin adı ve telefon numarası bilginizi vererek şifre isteğinizi bildiren bir e-posta gönderiniz. E-Liste servis yöneticisi talebiniz üzerine gerekli incelemeleri gerçekleştirecek, talebin uygun görülmesi durumunda sizinle telefon aracılığıyla iletişime geçecektir. E-Liste yöneticiliğinde bir değişiklik söz konusu olduğunda, önceki e-liste yöneticisi yeni liste yöneticisinin e-posta adresini listenin yönetim arayüzü üzerinde yönetici olarak tanımlamalı ve yönetim şifresini yeni yöneticiye teslim etmelidir. Ancak, liste yöneticisinin yeni yöneticiyi tanımlamadan ve şifreyi aktarmadan görevden ayrılması gibi durumlarda, farklı bir kişinin liste yöneticisi olarak tanımlanmasına BİDB tarafından destek verilebilmektedir. Böyle bir durum söz konusu ise, ilgili listenin yeni yöneticisi olacak kişinin konuyla ilgili talebini "metu.edu.tr" uzantılı e-posta adresini kullanarak mailmanmetu.edu.tr adresine iletmesi gerekmektedir. Söz konusu liste üniversitedeki bir birime ait ise, bu talep ilgili birimin yöneticisi tarafından iletilmelidir. Talebin BİDB'na ulaşmasının ardından, talep sahibi ile iletisime geçilerek gerekli işlemler gerçekleştirilecektir. (Yukarıda geçen "abc-l" ifadesi liste ismi için örnek olarak verilmiştir.)

FAQ Question: I am the administrator of "abc-l" list. Can I change the name of the list? (in Turkish)
FAQ Answer:   Mailman sisteminde liste isim degişikliği teknik olarak mümkün değildir. Bu amaca yönelik talep gelmesi durumunda "xyz-l" listesi açılır, "abc-l" listesinin üye ve yapılandırma bilgileri "xyz-l" listesine aktarılır. Talep edilmesi durumunda "abc-l" arşivi de "xyz-l" listesine kopyalanır. Ancak arşiv aktarımında sorun yaşanmaması ile ilgili bir garanti verilmemektedir.

FAQ Question: I do not want to receive messages from university administration via genel-duyuru etc. What can I do? (in Turkish)
FAQ Answer:   Üniversitemiz yönetimince mensuplarımız için çeşitli duyuru listeleri tanımlanmıştır. Öğrencilerin, akademik ve idari personelin bu listelere üyelikleri bir otomasyonla sağlanmaktadır. Bu sebeple üyelikten çıkış taleplerine yönetim kararı uyarınca izin verilmemektedir.

FAQ Question: I have forgotten the password of an electronic list that I have subscribed, how can I get it? (in Turkish)
FAQ Answer:   E-listelerde kullanılan üyelik şifreleri, merkezi kullanıcı kodları için kullanılan şifrelerden farklı olup, herhangi bir listeye üye olunduğunda Mailman yazılımı tarafından otomatik olarak tanımlanıp e-liste üyelerine gönderilen şifrelerdir. E-liste servisi kapsamında merkezi e-posta adresleri dışındaki e-posta adresleri ile de e-listelere üye olunabildiği için, e-liste arşivlerine ulaşımda merkezi kullanıcı şifreleri kullanılamamaktadır. E-liste şifresini hatırlamayan bir kullanıcı, bir e-listeye gönderilmiş mesajın ekinde yer alan eklenti dosya bağlantısına tıkladığında veya doğrudan http://mailman.metu.edu.tr/mailman/private/liste_adi şeklindeki e-liste arşiv giriş ekranının adresini yazarak, arşive giriş yapacağı sayfaya ulaşabilir. E-liste şifresini öğrenmek için, bu sayfada e-listeye üyelik için kullandığı e-posta adresini yazıp _x0093_Hatırlat_x0094_ butonuna basması yeterlidir.  Bu işlem sonrasında e-liste şifresi kullanıcının e-posta adresine aşağıdaki gibi bir mesaj ile gönderilecektir:  Burada, "Your <e-liste-adı> password is:" ifadesinin karşısında "****" ile belirtilmiş olan alanda yer alan bilgi, e-liste şifre bilgisidir. Kullanıcı bu şifreyi kullanarak mesaj ekinde yer alan eklenti dosyalara ulaşabilir ve e-liste arşivinde yer alan geçmiş tüm mesajları okuyabilir (E-liste yazılımı olan "Mailman", üye olunan her liste için ayrı şifre atamaktadır, ancak isteyen kullanıcılarımız üye oldukları tüm listeler için ortak bir şifre tanımlayabilirler).

FAQ Question: How can I change the file and directory permissions in Unix operating system with the 'chmod' command?
FAQ Answer:   In the Unix operating system, "ls" command displays the names of directories and file names. The user can also view the files according to his/her preferences from among some command options. -a Displays all the content of the directory including the hidden files beginning with '.' -l Lists files and gives details about them(date of last process, file permissions ) -t Lists the files according to the dates when these files are last modified. -R Lists all the files including the contents of subdirectories. In Unix, there are file permissions like read, write and execute for three categories of users, namely, file owner, group and others. The file permissions that are assigned to a file can be displayed with "ls -l" command.   bash-2.03$ ls -ltotal 100-rw------- 1 usrname usrgrp 1156 Nov 29 14:30 a_file-rw-r--r-- 1 usrname usrgrp   11 Dec 19 17:29 file1drwx------ 2 usrname usrgrp  512 Nov 29 14:44 maildrwxr-xr-x 5 usrname usrgrp  512 Nov 29 11:56 wwwhome   A closer look at the screen above will show that there are seven basic columns. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 drwxr-xr-x 5 username usergroup 512 Nov 29 11:56 wwwhome 1st Column This column shows the read, write and execute permissions of wwwhome directory. It includes 10 characters.   The first character in the permission sequence "drwxr-xr-x" can be "-", "d" or "l" and these characters simply signify "file", "directory" and "link" respectively. The remaining nine characters are grouped three by three. The first group signifies the owner's permissions, the second group signifies the group's permissions and the third group signifies other users' permissions. The three characters in these three groups signify respectively the read, write and execute permissions of all categories of users.  2nd Column; This column displays the number of links that are working in a file. The number of links for a directory indicates the total of links present in this directory and the directories linked to this directory. 3rd and 4th Columns; This column displays the user code and the group which the user belongs to, 5th Column; This column displays the size of the file or the total character number reserved for a file, 6th Column; This column displays the date when the last modification on the directory took effect, 7th Column This column displays the name of the directory or file. The read, write and execute permissions are specified or modified solely by the owner of the file. The permissions assigned to a file can be modified buy the "chmod" command. The command sequence is as follows; chmod [permissionmode] [filename]  Permission mode is comprised of the category characters, permit/prohibittance characters and the characters showing type of the permission. '+' sign gives file permissions, '-' sign omits the file permission. The file name is the name of the file whose file permissions would be changed. For example: bash-2.03$ chmod go-x wwwhome   1bash-2.03$ ls -l wwwhome        2total 102drwxr--r-- 2 username usergroup 512 Nov 29 11:56 wwwhome "chmod go-x" command is executed for the "wwwhome" directory on line 1 in the above example. In the second line, "ls -l"command checks the permissions of "wwwhome" directory. Apparently, no one other than the owner is permitted to write into and execute "wwwhome" any longer.

Students must register for both of their major and double major/minor programs separately and get approvals from advisors in both departments. Accepted students will contact the coordinators of Double Major / Minor Programs for both the courses they need to take and get registered at Add-Drop and Advisor Approval dates announced on the Academic Calendar (https://oidb.metu.edu.tr/en/academic-calendar).

They will also follow the same procedure for replacement. Common compulsory courses of the major and double major/minor programs must be taken in the same semester for both programs. Therefore, the system will not allow dropping a common compulsory course registered in one of the programs for which the registration approval has been obtained. If registration approval is not obtained, the course will be automatically dropped in one program when it is dropped in the other. Admitted students must enroll in their double major or minor programs each semester. If they do not register, they are dismissed from the double major/minor program by the registrar's office. Students who did not register and do not want to lose their registration rights should notify their requests to the relevant department for permission. Students who were registered in Double Major or Minor programs in the previous semesters and were accepted to Double Major or Minor programs again must delete their registration from their previous programs (as they cannot enroll in two Minor and two Double Major programs at the same time). https://oidb.metu.edu.tr/en/registrations-newly-admitted-international-students-graduate-programs Registrations of Newly Admitted International Students to Graduate Programs IMPORTANT DATES September 9-20, 2024 University Registrations and Document Submission (Online) - The program will open at 08:30 a.m. September 25-27, 2024 Interactive Course Registration & Advisor Approvals October 7-11, 2024 Add-Drop & Advisor Approvals IMPORTANT ISSUES Please make sure to read all information on this web page in detail to get all necessary and crucial information for a smooth registration process.

Sports Club Description: The METU Underwater Society was founded in 1985 by a group of METU students and faculty members as a student society affiliated with the Directorate of Sports within the METU Presidency. The basic principle adopted by METU SAT in its establishment is to research, protect and promote the historical, cultural and natural values ​​of the Turkish coasts and inland waters. The activities carried out within this scope include providing basic and advanced diving, search, rescue and first aid training to provide knowledge and skills to the members of the society; training divers for exploration and examination purposes; organizing research and promotional activities (such as competitions, panels, meetings and seminars) on the ecological values ​​(such as sea meadows, sea turtles, Mediterranean monk seals), natural values ​​(such as underwater caves, offshore rocks and marine life shelters) and cultural values ​​(such as shipwrecks, underwater archaeology, maritime history) of our coasts and inland waters. The society conducted a basic research study in Dalyan, a breeding beach for sea turtles in 1986/1987. The Mediterranean Monk Seal Protection Project also emerged from the METU Underwater Community in those years and has survived to the present day. The efforts to find and identify the Ottoman and Russian Command Ships that sank during the Ottoman-Russian Naval War in Çeşme Bay (1988-1990), the two 1600-year-old sunken ships found by the community on the coast of Antakya and the glass ingots found in each (1992/1993) are the first contributions of the METU Underwater Community to the science of archaeology. In addition to these, the “Underwater Image Hunting Competition” SAGAY, which the community organized for the first time in Bozcaada in 1992, is the first underwater photography competition organized in Turkey and aims to ensure the establishment and operation of “marine parks” in the Northern Aegean by offering a meaningful option such as Image Hunting with a Camera instead of Spear Fishing. Recently, the society has been carrying out important projects such as the Inventory of Sea Caves on the Coasts of Turkey Project, Archaeological Survey of Cilicia Region, Investigation of the Distribution of Sea Meadows, Uluburun III Artificial Reef Project, Free Diving Trials. METU Underwater Society is responsible to the Rectorate.
