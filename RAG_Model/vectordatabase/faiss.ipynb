Not only does the art production postdating World War II raise the questions of what art is or can be, but it is also concerned with endless possible ways in which the audiences can experience art. Contemporary art employs a range of new materials and technologies, questions the validity of intentionality and authorship, and addresses previously excluded audiences. It invades non-art spaces, blurs the boundaries between text and image, document and performance, asks questions about institutional frames (the museum, gallery, and art journal), and generates new forms of criticism. Much of the canon of what counts as important is still in flux, especially for the last twenty years.

Food is not only a bare necessity, it is also the medium through which knowledge, tradition and even history are transmitted, known and shared by all. The concept of ?foodscapes? emerged in the 1990s within the context of studies of social and spatial inequalities in public health and food systems. Since then, it has incorporated the study of the entire chain of food from its production to consumption especially in the context of changing notions of landscape and space. This course intends to introduce the term 'foodscape' as a part of urban studies. The term and its connotations will be explored through various aspects of urban and rural life; it is not just a material space, but includes socio-political processes. The course aims to investigate how food shapes and is shaped by the spatial characteristics of urban and rural environments, considering the historical, cultural, and socio-economic factors that contribute to the diversity of food experiences in places. Different approaches, such as analytical, systematical, or phenomenological, will be explored to develop a holistic spatial approach to urban and rural foodscapes. Each week, examples from around the world will be presented around specific themes to enrich the understanding of general concepts. Throughout the course, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the spatial intricacies that define a city's culinary identity. The course encourages a critical examination of the role of food in shaping the urban experience whereby the students will critically analyze the spatial dimensions of urban foodscapes, gaining insights into the interconnectedness of feasting, market spaces, and broader spatial dynamics that shape the culinary landscapes of cities. \"),\n",

The course aims to make a survey of the development of design practice in production sector and the outline of the transformation of production system from the mid-18th century pre-industrialization period also focusing on the earlier craft production system, and the following industrialization period, then the development of industrial design during modernization period to today. Following the early periods, it is indispensable to focus on modernism and the modernist assumptions/understanding/teachings behind design and industrial design, so to make a survey of modern design and industrial design to identify/understand/reflect upon the theoretical underpinnings of modernism in the practical and theoretical aspects of design and industrial design. The main objective of the course is to develop a critical perspective on the historical transformation, concepts and significant issues related to the development of modern design and industrial design. Particularly, change, transition and transformation occupy the agenda of the course as formative concepts; for the social, cultural and economic domains have undergone a considerable transformation and change within the changing economic, social and production relations through the course of the 19th century industrial revolution and the following 20th century capitalist system. The early 20th century developments opened a niche for the emergence of âindustrial designâ as a recognized profession when it has become an indispensable part of industrial; later post-industrial, socio-technological and consumer culture in the West. Furthermore, this situation has been gradually becoming similar for Turkey. As a candidate industrial designer, to reflect upon these issues will eventually and hopefully help to place the role of oneself generally within the technological and consumer culture of todayâs system of industrial, economic and social relations. \\nContent:  Covers the period from industrialization (from the mid 18th century toward the end of the 19th century) to the years between two world wars. Focuses on the developments which led to the emergence of industrial design as a separate profession by developing an overall perspective on concepts and prominent issues related to design and industrial design. Aims to enable students to understand the events, issues and concepts that are significant for the historical transformation of production, production relations and transformation of design. Aims to enable students to develop a critical perspective on the theoretical and professional aspects of design and industrial design. '),\n",

The answer to this question lies in finding a criterion by means of which philosophy can be differentiated from science and various other human activities. The rest of the course discusses the following basic topics. Validity of arguments (logic), the nature of truth and knowledge (epistemology), the fundamental categories of being (ontology), the meaning of linguistic expressions (philosophy of language), scientific concepts and theories (philosophy of science), the distinction between morally good and bad (ethics), and, finally beauty in nature and value of artworks (aesthetics).

Bringing these ethical frameworks to bear on contemporary ethical issues, this course seeks to combine theoretical and applied approaches to ethics. Beginning with the question of âthe good life,â we shall ask: Why live ethically? And how to live ethically? Tracing how each philosopher with whom we engage responds to these questions, the students are expected to develop an understanding of different kinds of ethical reasoning, which in turn would enable them to analyze issues and propose an informed, intelligent response. As their final project, the students will write a paper in which they take up a specific ethical problem (e.g. capital punishment, suicide, prostitution, torture, hunger strike, pornography, etc.) and argue for a position by utilizing and building on the kinds of ethical reasoning we traced and scrutinized throughout the semester. \\nContent:  Problems of moral conduct.

In this course, we will cover some historical material as well as readings from contemporary epistemology literature.\\xa0 The course will have three main philosophical/discursive axes: (1) Epistemology of Perception, (2) Theories of Justification, and finally (3) Feminist Epistemology.\\xa0 In dealing with (2) above, emphasis will be placed especially on the debate between foundationalism and coherentism.\\xa0 And we will study part (3) as an example of the contemporary reaction to traditional analytic epistemology. Grading:\\xa0 Students will write two in-class examinations: (1) The mid-term exam will probably take place in April (40% grade value); (2) The remaining part of your total grade will come from the final exam (60% grade value). \\xa0Please note that if you take only one of those two exams, you will get an âFâ grade. \\nContent:  Common-sense knowledge and scientific knowledge.

It is crucial for the guidance of individuals, corporations, and governments in determining the principles affecting their policies, lifestyles, and actions across the entire range of environmental issues. It is controversial for the complexity of environment, conflict of interest in environment, and human centered ethical traditions, concepts and theories neglecting non-human environment. So while uncertainty and conflict of interest increase the demands on ethical principles, the basic assumptions of traditional ethics are difficult to extend to the non-human environment. Environmental ethics must also be a theoretical field of ethics to deal, for example, with the following problems. People have rights, but do other (higher) animals? Do plants even have interests? Can only individuals deserve to be subject for moral considerations or can group of individuals, such as species and ecosystem also? These and similar questions are treated by both anthropocentrists and ecocentrists. '),\n",

As an introductory course, it requires no pre-knowledge of philosophy. It tries to explore the role that emotion plays in the acquisition of  beliefs and desires, the relation between them, and their transformation into actions and policies. It studies also emotions considered as a component of life and experience and investigate whether they may themselves be subject to rational assessment. For this purpose it goes to the historical roots of the problem of emotions, e.g. what role does it play in our life? What is an emotion? These questions are important in the philosophy of mind and ethics. Philosophers have not always despised the importance of emotions. Hume, for example, claimed that reason is and ought to be, the slave of passion. Nietzsche, on the other hand, insisted that emotion and reason are not really opposite but complementary to each other. In this course, the claims of important philosophers are discussed and moral, aesthetic political implications of their view of emotion are criticized. '),\n",

The fundamental question discussed in this course is how philosophy, ordinary life and literature are related. How can we draw boundary line between philosophy and literature? How are literary works structured? With these questions the course addresses the philosophical question about the role of art in human life. The continuity of everyday life and the coherence of artistic literature are distinct though closely related. In ancient Greece, Literature was crucial for philosophyÂ´ s own self definition. Subsequent philosophy of literature has been denoted to overcoming PlatoÂ´s condemnatory theory. The vast majorities of theories follow Plato in treating literature as a distinct domain, separate from and subordinate to philosophy. But since Romanticism, some have argued for the essential unity of these two enterprises. The course studies the relation between life, literature and philosophy within historical context as well as in contemporary culture. '),\n",

These two periods, then, overlap. To the extent they can be genuinely teased apart, the medieval period is marked by adherence to monotheistic religious tenets and authority as well as to Aristotle, while the Renaissance sees the rediscovery of pre-Christian thought and a decreasing reliance on prior texts and thinkers. However, none of these qualifications can be taken as fully descriptive of either period and their similarities and differences will become apparent in equal measure as we move through the material. As this is a survey course covering approximately 1200 years of philosophy, it is impossible to do justice to either period, more so than in other survey courses. That said, we will read many of their most important thinkers. We begin with Augustine of Hippo (354-430) and his sermon on the sacking of Rome in 410. We then move to selections from the Roman senator Boethius (477-524); the great Islamic philosophers Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 980-1037) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes, 1126-1198); and the high watermarks of medieval Christian thought as found in Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) and John Duns Scotus (1265/6-1308). With that, we move into the Renaissance with readings from Nicholas of Cusaâs (1401-1464) On Learned Ignorance, NiccolÃ² Machivelliâs (1469-1527) Prince, Martin Lutherâs (1483-1546) âNinety-five Theses,â the Coimbra Commentaries (1591-1606), and closing with Francisco SuÃ¡rezâs (1548-1617) Metaphysical Disputations. \\nContent:  Survey of post-Aristotelian and medieval philosophies. philosophy in the Renaissance; Humanism; controversy between the Platonists and the Aristotelians; scepticism, and Reformation.

In this course, as we examine the evolutionary thinking by the work of a number of key representative figures in the past and present we will also be questioning as to whether scientific theories, in general, and the evolutionary theory, in particular, are social constructions by searching for values inherent in scientific theories and research. COURSE OBJECTIVES: The aim of this course is to demonstrate students by concrete examples from the history of evolutionary biology that, although science involves social (nonscientific/epistemic) values both in discovering and testing scientific theories, it, nevertheless, progresses and achieves objective knowledge by removing these values from science.

However, 2nd year students may get enrolled as well. Moreover, there may be a small room for students of other departments, who are seriously interested in the course. \\xa0 Course Syllabus: This course contains a substantial reading component. The purpose of this course is to improve studentsâ reading skills needed for philosophy as well as to discuss what philosophical activity is all about by studying Platoâs dialogue the Meno, and by doing so we shall study Platoâs philosophy and shed some light on what he might understand this activity. \\xa0 This course firstly aims at introducing you to the practice of reading in philosophy by studying thoroughly a text in the Western philosophical tradition. Students will also get to grasp some problems that have been significant to philosophy from its beginnings, the major one of which is the problem of knowledge. In the process of thoroughly studying the text and the arguments appearing in the text, you will develop your own philosophical and analytical skills. \\xa0 As for Platoâs philosophy and his understanding of what this activity entails, the course will also include instruction in finding and defining problems, formulating questions to capture the problems defined, arrangement, developing arguments, revision, and strategies of research. \\xa0 \\nContent:  The course will be concerned with the selected dialogues of Plato. After a brief introduction to Plato`s conception of Socratic 2410osophizing (in Apology, Crito, Euthyphro) we will trace the development of Plato`s ethical theory from the Socratic ethics of the Protagoras to the Platonic ethics of the Republic; and Plato`s metaphysical theory from the Meno and Phaedo to the Republic and Timaeus. Finally, some attention will be given to his theory of knowledge in the later dialogues, especially the Theaetetus, the Parmenides, and the Sophist. '),\n",

Topics and problems to be covered throughout the course will be selected from the following list ânot all topics may be covered in any one semester: * What is special about the scientific method? What constitutes a scientific approach to investigating the world? Why be scientific? Science vs. pseudo-science or good vs. bad science. * Does science make inductive assumptions? Does it simply generalise from the cases already investigated? If so, how are such inductive assumptions to be justified? * Can evidence ever establish scientific theories? If not, what exact role does empirical testing play in science? The role of experiment in the scientific method; the Duhem-Quine Problem; the empirical basis of science; weight of evidence and predictive success. * Are there any special problems concerned with testing statistical or probabilistic theories? * Scientific explanation; what are ad hoc explanations and moves? Why should they be avoided in science? * What is the status of presently accepted scientific theories? The problem of theory-choice (or theory-change) and scientific rationality. What are revolutionary-theory-changes in science? How do revolutionary-theory-changes in science affect the view that science consists of a body of established truths? And how does the phenomenon of revolutionary changes in science affect traditional notions of scientific rationality? Do scientific revolutions involve changes in scientific methodology? \\nContent:  Historical and epistemological evaluation of some rationality theories, e.g., Popper`s Falsificationism, Kuhn`s Scientific Revolutions, Feyerabend`s Liberalism, Lakatos`s MSRP and Structural Realism.

So it has some weakness to represent faithfully what went on when such a discovery came about.

Who benefits from those limits as determined in a particular fashion? What allows the beneficiaries to benefit and others not to benefit, if that occurs? Should the number of the beneficiaries of the limits of sovereignty themselves be limited? If the limitation of sovereignty necessarily limits its beneficiaries, should sovereignty be limited?

PHILOSOPHY OF MIND I  Lecturer: Majid D. Beni Email: mbeni@metu.edu.tr Office hours: Time and venue: Wednesdays 10.40-13.40 (hybrid) \\xa0 Course description:  The course introduces and explores the main issues of the philosophy of mind including the following ones: what is the mind, and how it is related to the body and the world? Can there be mindfulness independently of bodily modes? Can computers think? How does the mind represent the external world? Can connectionist networks embed representations? What is consciousness? The course considers some of the significant philosophical replies to those questions. It is organized into three main parts. The first part is concerned with the nature of mind and its relationship with the body. The second part focuses on the questions of how to model mind and how to account for its representational capacities (if any). The third part overviews discussions of intentionality, consciousness, and selfhood. Upon successful completion of the course, the students will acquire the requisite skills to understand some of the main discussions of the field and articulate arguments for and against different positions and examine them critically. \\xa0 The course outcome:  To develop the skill to read and write about topics presented in the course and similar topics. To understand and critically discuss the basic metaphysical and epistemological views on the nature of the mind and its relationship with the body. To be able to see the relation between epistemological and metaphysical views on the one hand and some fundamental theories of the cognitive sciences and computer science on the other. To be able to reconstruct and critically evaluate the main replies to the questions about the nature of the mind and its relationship with the world. \\xa0 \\xa0 Sources: The mandatory text for each session is marked by â*â. The students need to read mandatory texts ahead of each session so as to be prepared for well-informed participations. There are also further readings. \\xa0 \\xa0 Coursework and distribution of grades: Reading reports: Each student must submit (via email to mbeni@metu.edu.tr) three reading reports. The reports could be based on any of the core texts that will be studied during the semester, but the students must submit their report before Monday of the week during which the respective text will be discussed in the classroom. The reading reports are supposed to be around 300 words, identifying the main thesis and extracting the basic structure of the argument of the author. Reading reports amount to 15% of the grade. Participation: participations mainly consist of oral discussions during sessions. They are supposed to be well-informed and thoughtful and are highly valued in this course. They include 15% of the grade, group presentations included. For group presentations, students could form groups of up to 5 people. Intermediate exams: there are two intermediate exams, closed book, during the fifth and ninth weeks of the semester. It constitutes 30% of the studentâs grade. Final exam: it is opened-book, the students could use their laptops and have access to the internet, they are required to choose one topic amongst three suggested ones and write one short essay between 2000-3000 words about the topic. 40% of the grade is for the final exam. \\xa0 Attendance policy: Attendance is important. When unable to attend for an important reason such as illness or family emergency, the student may discuss the situation with me as soon as possible (preferably through email, before the session).

After a brief introduction to Kant`s philosophy and its relation to empiricist and rationalist philosophies, we will pay particular attention to Kant`s conception of `critique`. We will trace how Kant explores the possibility of a priori knowledge and of transcendental subjectivity. Finally, we will discuss the problem of the unity of reason, i.e., the unity of reason in its theoretical and practical employment. In this respect, we will bring the first Critique into dialogue with the second Critique. \"),\n",

No other question has ever moved so profoundly the spirit of man; no other idea has so fruitfully stimulated his intellect; yet no other concept stands in greater need of clarificationâ¦.â As pointed out by Hilbert, the concept of infinity has been an important topic in philosophy since the time of early Greek philosophers. In addition to its philosophical importance, it also has significant mathematical aspects. For example, the concept forms the basis of some counter-intuitive mathematical results, such as being able to paint an infinite surface with a finite amount of paint. Thus, a thorough investigation of the concept of infinity will need to have both a philosophical dimension and a mathematical/logical dimension. This proposed course aims to provide such an investigation. The investigation will be carried out in three overlapping dimensions: historical, metaphysical, and mathematical. In the first dimension, the development of the concept of infinity will be traversed, starting from early Greek thought and ending with 20th century views on infinity. The main focus of the metaphysical dimension of the course will be the distinction between potential infinity and actual infinity. The arguments for and against the existence of actual infinity will be thoroughly examined. In addition to these arguments, the metaphysical dimension of the course will also include an analysis of human finitude and the possibility of infinite beings. The mathematical dimension will cover early paradoxes of motion and time, Galileoâs âparadoxâ, Torricelliâs trumpet, Cantorâs transfinite mathematics, and some theorems relevant to the discussion of infinity. \\nContent:  Sorry no data is found for the course objective.

In the first half of the course we will discuss inter alia the following: our conception of the human soul; the onto-epistemology of death; common conception of death as being âmysteriousâ; death and literature (the case of Elias Canetti); the contemporary approach to aging and dying in our culture; characterization of life as fabulae; and the existential-hermeneutic philosophy (specifically, Martin Heideggerâs view) regarding death as the ultimate phenomenological limit. In the second half of the course we will focus chiefly on the notion of âharm due to dyingâ.\\xa0 We will start with a classical view presented by Epicurus (4th cent. B.C.E.) and study the contemporary reaction the his âharm argumentâ.\\xa0 We will also briefly discuss the Ancient and Spinozistic approaches to death.\\xa0 Another major issue we will talk about will be the concept of immortality.\\xa0 We will examine the notion of immortality, and then consider the pertinent analyses and philosophically evaluate its desirability.

The rationale behind this course is that what may hold true in many contemporary, Western European and North American societies is not necessarily the norm in other societies. In order to better understand these differences, we will examine psychological constructs and theories through relativist and universalist perspectives, sometimes referred to as cultural psychology and cross-cultural psychology, respectively. This examination will seek to compare and contrast what is universal in human behavior and what is shaped and interpreted by cultural variations. \\nContent:  A general overview to the field of cultural and cross-cultural psychology that aims to examine a selection of the theoretical, empirical and applied issues of human behavior across cultures.

Moreover, the characteristics of ideal outdoor environment, risk and safety in outdoor environment will be studied. The course will also focus on the pedagogies related to nature-based education, the relation between sustainability and outdoor education. In addition, participants in this course will be provided strategies to plan planning outdoor activities for young children and effective teacher strategies in outdoor environments. \\xa0 \\nContent:  The importance of outdoor play is widely acknowledged by early childhood researchers.  However, studies, which are conducted to investigate teachers\\x92 outdoor play practices, proposed educational implications in relation to in-service and pre-service training programs about outdoor education. They suggested that in-service and pre-service teacher training programs are needed about facilitation of children\\x92s outdoor play by teachers. As those researchers indicated, in-service teacher training could be one way to form teachers\\x92 beliefs and improve their outdoor play practices. However, when teachers are graduated from university and participated to the regular system, they have generally configured their beliefs in relation to teaching and learning. When it is considered that beliefs are resistant to change, the role of pre-service teacher training programs in constructing pre-service teachers\\x92 beliefs becomes more crucial. In other words, pre-service teacher training programs might be more effective to construct pre-service teachers\\x92 beliefs of outdoor education and to make them capable in terms of facilitating children\\x92s outdoor play and learning. In this regard, several research that have been conducted to examine the role of pre-service teacher training programs in forming pre-service teachers\\x92 beliefs constitute an evidence for this foresight. From this point of view, providing an outdoor education course for pre-service teachers would be golden opportunity to train qualified and capable students in the issue of outdoor education. In addition, in Turkey, curriculum for early childhood education suggested teachers to conduct learning activities in outdoor environment as much as possible. Based on this guide curriculum, teachers are expected to create their own plans. At that point, as the teachers will be decision makers of the curriculum and classroom it is important to make pre-service students to develop positive attitudes toward outdoor education. Due to aforementioned reasons, presenting a course for outdoor education is significant for pre-service early childhood teacher training program. '),\n",

First of all, the course will try to discuss how to sociologically conceptualize  what a `disaster`is? what is a `hazard`? What is a`hazard risk`? Why we cannot justify the term `natural` to explain disasters? How can we understand the root drivers behind disasters? The course will then continue with a brief analysis of different theoretical discussions and sociological perspectives for understanding disasters? The course will continue explaining how disasters may enhance the previous social inequalities before and may lead to multidimensional, contextual and intersectional vulnerabilities during and after the disasters. The course will then focus on the difference between `disaster risk management` and `disaster risk reduction` approaches. While the first one is emphasizing the period after a disaster, the later refers to preventive strategies, referring to risk perception, awareness and preparedness. The role of NGOs will be also covered in the course. Especially there will be a discussion on whether we can talk of a  `recovery` or a major social change after a disaster. In the course, various major disasters experienced in the world will be presented. Among them disaster/climate change induced migration will be particularly emphasized. '),\n",

It is based on classic anthropological and sociological texts written by Western and Turkish scholars that students should read and rely on since these texts allow us to better understand and comprehend the debates on Turkish modernization. The tension or conflict between traditionalism and modernization with an emphasis on the gender dimension of the process of modernization in Turkey is another theme of the course. This course is also about the multiple methods of data collection and methodological approaches in the fields of sociology and social anthropology.

Following this framework, the process of nation-state building in Turkey is discussed with reference to various forms of resistance movements and formal political opposition experienced between the years of 1919 and the early 1940s.

Although environmental sociology encompasses a large and growing literature, the course will focus upon several prominent works and will introduce students to the fundamental issues and debates in the field. Promote studentsâ ability to evaluate the existing research and to understand its implications. Class discussions, lectures, writing assignments, and the final paper will all help in the realization of this goal. Promote the development of a global perspective on environmental issues. Just as processes of environmental and social change are linked, developments originating in isolated regions often have worldwide implications. Conversely, global trends are often particularly manifest in specific locales. This course will attempt to make those critical connections evident. Enhance studentsâ writing and research abilities. Toward this end, each student in the course will complete regular writing assignments and a research paper.  \\nContent:  Environmental sociology is a field of inguiry that focuses on the relationship between society and the biophysical environment. This course will consider social relationships at both the global and local levels, as well as in urban and rural localities. It examines how human societies affect the environment and how human societies are shaped by the environment.'),\n",

By exploring foodwaysâthe traditions and customs in production, consumption and distribution of foodâof others and ours, we will learn the different ways of using food to create and present identities; how and in what circumstances people use food to distinguish them from one another as well as connect with others?\\xa0 How do they recreate new identities or diminish old ones in order to be accepted in new places or by new people?\\xa0 The primary goal of this course is to develop a critical awareness of cultural similarities as much as differences.\\xa0 Throughout the course, you should always ask yourself: What is culture?  We study food as an academic subject through readings, films and class/group discussions.\\xa0 There are no right and wrong opinions as each of us have a different background, which has shaped our perspectives.\\xa0 However, you should be thinking about food in terms of anthropology.\\xa0 As a final project, you will do a food-based research paperâto examine food of other culture rather than your own, such as outside your region, ethnicity, religion, class, and gender. \\xa0In your paper, you should pose a central research question, for example, âHow do people in America present their class identity through sushi consumption?â or âHow is simit significant to everyday life in Turkey?â\\xa0 By examining the ways by which others shape their identity through food, you learn about their culture and people.\\xa0 This helps you to be self-reflective with your own culture as well.\\xa0 In your research paper, you should discuss how a particular food impacts peopleâs everyday life and the ways by which they form their identities.\\xa0 \\nContent:  The course probes such social and cultural questions as  Â´Are there different kinds of rationality? Â´,  Â´Does language limit and control thought? Â´,  Â´What kind of difficulties arise when we attempt to translate from one language, or culture, into another?,  Â´Are there universal moral principles? Â´,  Â´Is it possible to compare different cultures? Â´ Basic concepts such as self, reason and sanity, money and wealth, religious beliefs, and health will be subjected to critique. '),\n",

It surveys major topics, theoretical definitions/debates and approaches in the field of race and ethnicity. Moreover, it also examines social and ethnic relations as part of larger social systems by emphasizing the relationship between ethnicity on the one hand and nations, state, class, minority groups, gender, power, and politics on the other. \\xa0 The aim of the course is to provide academic background, conceptual clarity, and guidance to the students around the key concepts of race and ethnicity. Classical studies on nationalism and state-formation emphasize territoriality, clearly delimited boundaries, and a homogenous population with a focus on universalism, inclusion, civility, modern tolerance, transnational integration and civic nationhood. The increasing emphasis on particularity, exclusion, violence, ancient hatreds, and national disintegration (stemming mainly from the post-communist east Europe and the former Soviet Union and the increasing number of immigrants in Europe) constitutes a challenge to the analytical gains of the mainstream literature on nationalism. In this context ethnic group formation, ethnic integration and ethnic conflict appear among the defining phenomena of the modern era. While one understanding in the field of race and ethnicity emphasizes membership in definite groups (similarity), the other emphasizes cultural differentiation (difference); both aiming to explain and understand human diversity through the processes of social identification and interaction. Ethnic integration and ethnic conflict can be divided into several sub-categories, such as assimilation, melting pot or cultural pluralism (multiculturalism) on the one hand and discrimination, ethnic cleansing or genocide on the other. Since ethnic groups can (and often do) generate various forms of conflict, ethnicity appears as one of the most controversial topics in the literature. Most theoretical approaches to understanding racial and ethnic identification or racial and ethnic relations remain inconclusive. Thus, it is important to emphasize a broader understanding of the concept of ethnicity as a social phenomenon. Ethnicity also has political, historical, economic, and religious dimensions none of which can be ignored. In this context, conceptions like âthe return of the repressedâ or âelite manipulationâ need to be critically reconsidered in relation to the concepts of collective identity (and its expressive forms) and (ethnic and racial) social movements.\\xa0 \\nContent:  The course examines the formation and dynamics of ethnic groups in the contemporary world.

Moving from the European colonial expansion and the Caribbean transnationalism as a starting point of problematization, our discussion will often revolve broadly around the intersection of political economy and political ecology. We will critically discuss such issues as the relational and intersecting processes of appropriation of nature through human labor, the production of space and social ecologies; appropriation of laborâs surplus by the owners of the means of production; and the relational and transnational formation of social identities such as race, ethnicity, and gender through a historical perspective both in colonial and post-colonial contexts across the globe. Course Objectives:  To introduce and debate the relationality among the labor regimes, surplus extraction, land ownership systems and the construction of various social identities along different axes of social difference such as race, gender, ethnicity, and nationality. To problematize and discuss the differences between, imperialism, transnationalism, colonialism, post-colonialism, nationalism, and universalism through a historical materialist framework by specifically examining class formations, land ownership and labor regimes in the context of the emergence and consolidation of European political modernity. To discuss how above-mentioned processes are integral to the production of socio-ecological environments various peoples lived in and the historical formation of contemporary globalized political-ecological issues.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0  Course Requirements Attendance and Participation (20%) Attending the seminar: 1 point each week (14 Points in Total) Attending the discussion: 6 Points in total Inasmuch as you are free to come and go to our seminars as you like as free individuals, this course will evaluate your ability to bring your bodies and ideas into the classroom. There is a reason for such tyranny: The true gift of seminars is its collectivity, or what Marx calls âthe natural advantages of cooperationâ in the production process. It is in the classroom where we have a chance to express the way we read texts, hear othersâ way of reading them, and challenge ourselves and our fellow readers in a fruitful collective environment. Honest intellectual engagement in class discussions is, after all, the most challenging demand this course will impose on you.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 Critical Discussion Leading (10%)  Throughout the semester each of you will spin-off the in-class discussion with a presentation that should take 10-to-15-minutes. If the number of students exceed 13, this presentation can be done in pairs, in which case the two parts of the presentation should not exceed 20 minutes in total. You are expected to critically review the assignments of the week, lay down the main arguments and major points of discussion and put them into a dialogue with each other and the other texts of the syllabus whenever possible. Note that this excludes simple summaries. The primary aim of this exercise is to encourage you to construct a productive intellectual engagement with the assigned texts rather than being passive recipients. The experience from the past few semesters shows that it becomes very productive when you come up with critical questions derived from the text(s) to enrich your presentation. This enables us to pick up those questions to facilitate the discussion. When there are multiple texts in a particular week, you are expected to cover all the assigned readings and metabolize them in a single presentation. Note that the presentations that are unable to lay down the main arguments and crucial points of discussion in 15 minutes (20 if there are two presenters) and take longer are subject to point loss. It is an important skill to be able structure your talk in a time that is allocated to you, be it 5 minutes, 15 minutes or more. It is possible to identify the main arguments and major points of discussion of any text in 15 minutes, unless you try to summarize it.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Reading Notes (21%) Throughout the semester you will write two-page response papers to seven weekly assignments of your choice. Each will account for 3% of your final grade. The principles of discussion leading applies to the notes as well. I would like you to critically discuss the assigned texts but given that you have two pages, you are encouraged to pick a point or two that you identify as interesting, important or vital for understanding the texts. You may again put these points into a dialogue with other texts of the course whenever possible. Note that this excludes simple summaries. The papers should be uploaded to turn-it-in until midnight on Tuesdays in order to facilitate the in-class discussion the next day. Since late papers would defeat this purpose, they will not be evaluated. You should come prepared to make those points and be able to defend them in the classroom when necessary. Term Paper (50%) You will submit a final paper at the end of the semester. Your term paper topic is entirely up to you, i.e., you can problematize any aspect of this course, as long as it inspires you, be it theoretical/conceptual or empirical. You can consult me anytime if you are not sure how your intended paper topic could address the debates covered throughout the semester. No matter what your topic is about, I expect you to construct your research topic, produce clear research questions, which will then determine the literature you will review in order to situate your paper and your arguments. This holistic and relational methodology/epistemology will be part of our discussions throughout the semester, which will help you with the construction of your paper. Your papers should be 15-20 pages. (Double-spaced, times new roman font, size 12.) Academic dishonesty and the expropriation of labor of others in any form will not be tolerated. This is not because you have to respect the intellectual private property rights, but the labor of others. \\nContent:  The course explores the relational and intersecting processes of appropriation of nature through human labor, the production of space and social ecologies; appropriation of the surplus created by labor by the owners of the means of production; formation of social identities such as race, ethnicity and class through a historical perspective both in colonial and post-colonial contexts across the globe.

This is mostly due to a revival of religion as a global fact. Developments such as Islamic fundamentalist upsurges and the resurgence of religion in world affairs after the events of 9/11, and more recently, the formation of ISIS, the\\xa0Charlie Hebdo\\xa0attack have put religion and secularism among the crucial issues not only in Western societies but also in Muslim-minority and Muslim-majority societies including Turkey. These recent developments have also brought questions about free speech into sharp focus. Decreasing commitment to traditional religions and the modern disconnection between faith communities and socio-cultural identities via the development of new religious movements are conducive to the development of fundamentalism. Also, individualization of faith and the disassociation of faith communities from ethnic and national identities are becoming widespread. In other words, the divide between culture and religion is growing as an important social fact and thus, attracting the attention of many sociologists. Especially since the so called âwar on terrorâ, the academic debate over the compatibility of Islam with secularism and democracy has become a subject of public discussion and thus, the issue of secularism a major research topic for sociologists. The main debates that the sociologists studying religion and secularism are engaged in, are as follows: The relationship between secularism/secular state and democracy; the place of Shariâa in Muslim societies; The relationship between Islam and the state throughout the history of Islam; the (im)possibility of realizing an âIslamic Stateâ; the (possible) consequences of the coercive enforcement of Shariâa by the state; the threat of majoritarianism; the perception of Islamic upsurge in the West; the failure of the idea that we are living in a secular world, especially considering the limited secularization and secularism experienced in Muslim societies; the axiomatic nature of belief in the Muslim world as opposed to the West; attempts of creating a secular ethic and the difficulty in determining the principles of such ethic through a consensus; and the visibility of\\xa0\\xa0religious markers in the public space have been hot topics for sociologists studying religion and secularism.\\xa0 The study of Muslim-minority and Muslim-majority societies, especially of the case of Turkey, will contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between Islam, secularization and the secular state; the increasingly important role that religion plays in these societies and the debates over the importance of secularism for the establishment of democratic political regimes.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\nContent:  The principal aim of this course is to acquaint students with the secularization process, the secular state in predominantly Muslim societies and also in Muslim-minority states. Experience of secularization, laicitÃ© and secular state, and the relationship between Islam and politics will be critically and comparatively examined in different countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Egypt, Iran, Israel and Turkey.
