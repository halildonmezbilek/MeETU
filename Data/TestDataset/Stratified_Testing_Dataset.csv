The first part of the course deals with the basics, which includes an engagement with the foundational concepts of the IR discipline as well as the concept of “theory” itself. In the second part of the course, we discuss the major paradigms –a concept you will become familiar with in this course– of IR. Paradigms for our purposes refer to the totality of assumptions, thought patterns, theories, research questions, methods, and programs pertaining to a collectively imagined framing of the social world. Part III examines the important omissions. Many of the major paradigms proceed from a structural understanding of world politics that focus on the interactions of states. They tend not to engage with deeper issues of world politics such as its main constituent actors like the state. We need to grapple with the nexus of system and unit-level phenomena by situating the state historically and among major IR theories. Next, we assess the state of knowledge production the discipline, focusing not only on the relative neglect of non-Western approaches to IR but also by problematizing the omission of gender as a significant factor in world politics. We will end the course by discussing the future of the international order via an appraisal/critique of contemporary U.S. foreign policy. At this point, students will be well placed to excel in their final take-home exam. The final, Part IV, looks at contemporary, critical and emancipatory aspects of IR Theory by scrutinizing the constituent elements of the social world and the power dynamics therein. It asks students to think about what other kinds of hierarchies exist in the social world.\n\nThis course offers a systematic and comprehensive survey of contending classical and contemporary, traditional and behavioral theories of international relations.\n\nCourse Link: https://catalog.metu.edu.tr/course.php?prog=314&course_code=3140422\n\nEntry 1249\n\nIR427: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.

For this purpose ideas of of great philosophers from Pythagoras to Postmodenism are discussed and moral, aesthetic and political implications of their views of philosophy and practice are studied and criticized.\n\nCourse Link: https://catalog.metu.edu.tr/course.php?prog=241&course_code=2410215\n\nEntry 1917\n\nPHIL235: This course belongs to DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY. Logic is the study of ""good"" reasoning. We all have some basic intuitions about what counts as ""good"" or ""acceptable"" reasoning, but those intuitions fail most of the time, especially in cases where reasoning is more complex. Logic is the discipline that formalizes those intuitions so that the failure of distinguishing ""good"" reasoning from ""bad"" reasoning is minimized. In this course, we will study one of the two main types of logic, i.e. deductive logic (the other being inductive logic). The topics that will be covered are validity, soundness, truth-table methods, natural deduction proof techniques and some metatheorems. The course will be useful for any student who aims to improve his/her analytical thinking skills.\n\n']","The Sophists are significant in the context of Western philosophy as they represent a philosophical school that emphasized the art of living and practical applications of philosophy, rather than merely abstract theory.

The course examines the formation and dynamics of ethnic groups in the contemporary world. It surveys major topics, theoretical definitions/debates and approaches in the field of race and ethnicity. Moreover, it also examines social and ethnic relations as part of larger social systems by emphasizing the relationship between ethnicity on the one hand and nations, state, class, minority groups, gender, power, and politics on the other. The aim of the course is to provide academic background, conceptual clarity, and guidance to the students around the key concepts of race and ethnicity. Classical studies on nationalism and state-formation emphasize territoriality, clearly delimited boundaries, and a homogenous population with a focus on universalism, inclusion, civility, modern tolerance, transnational integration and civic nationhood. The increasing emphasis on particularity, exclusion, violence, ancient hatreds, and national disintegration (stemming mainly from the post-communist east Europe and the former Soviet Union and the increasing number of immigrants in Europe) constitutes a challenge to the analytical gains of the mainstream literature on nationalism. In this context ethnic group formation, ethnic integration and ethnic conflict appear among the defining phenomena of the modern era. While one understanding in the field of race and ethnicity emphasizes membership in definite groups (similarity), the other emphasizes cultural differentiation (difference); both aiming to explain and understand human diversity through the processes of social identification and interaction. Ethnic integration and ethnic conflict can be divided into several sub-categories, such as assimilation, melting pot or cultural pluralism (multiculturalism) on the one hand and discrimination, ethnic cleansing or genocide on the other. Since ethnic groups can (and often do) generate various forms of conflict, ethnicity appears as one of the most controversial topics in the literature. Most theoretical approaches to understanding racial and ethnic identification or racial and ethnic relations remain inconclusive. Thus, it is important to emphasize a broader understanding of the concept of ethnicity as a social phenomenon. Ethnicity also has political, historical, economic, and religious dimensions none of which can be ignored. In this context, conceptions like “the return of the repressed” or “elite manipulation” need to be critically reconsidered in relation to the concepts of collective identity (and its expressive forms) and (ethnic and racial) social movements.\n\nThe course examines the formation and dynamics of ethnic groups in the contemporary world.

As for the guest houses, Osman Yazıcı Guest House, Guest House 12, and Dormitory 16 are allocated for female students, while Faik Hızıroğlu Guest House and Guest House 15 are allocated for male students. The Office of Dormitories, with the aim of solving our students' accommodation issues by offering a high standard service, obtained TSE-EN ISO 9001-2000 certificate of quality from the Turkish Standards Institution (TSE) in 2005. Regarding the quality of our dormitory services, the inspections carried out in 2021 in accordance with the TSE-EN ISO 9001:2015 standards were completed with success. The services provided by our unit are carried out according to the procedures, instructions, duties, and responsibilities determined within the Dormitory Regulations, Student Discipline Regulations of the higher education institutions, decisions taken by the Executive Board of Dormitories, and the certificates of quality. Therefore, every year, the Executive Board of Dormitories evaluates the dormitory applications of students based on the current capacity of dormitories, the number of applications, and the conditions for staying in the dormitories established in accordance with the aforementioned regulations and approved by the Rectorate. Then, the registration procedures of the students whose applications are accepted are conducted. We endeavor to provide 24/7 uninterrupted service that includes an environment of respect, love, equality and trust in our dormitories with an understanding that prioritizes a service that is high-quality, transparent, modern but at the same time adherent to the traditions of METU, which can only be achieved with a team spirit.\n\nEntry 2\n\n\n\nFacilities in the Dormitories: There is a mini-fridge in each room.

In addition, the dormitory offers students a bedding set consisting of bed sheet, blanket and pillow. Students can also bring and use their own bedding sets if they prefer to do so (but in this case, washing and cleaning these bedding sets will be their responsibility). In our dormitories, there are common studying rooms, TV rooms, laundry rooms, and kitchens as well as another common room for students of the Department of Architecture so that they can carry out their activities such as drawing. A sufficient number of automatic washing machines, dryers, irons, and ironing boards are available to students in the laundry rooms. The bedding sets in the room are changed periodically, but if need be, they can be changed outside their regular cycle as well. These bedding sets are washed and ironed in the laundry room, where industrial washing machines are used.

Therefore, users on the campus using Ansys CFD, Mechanical, and Electronics software use the same common HPC repository. As there may be more Ansys CFD and Mechanical users in the campus license, they may have used cores from the common HPC repository. Thus, users using Ansys Electronics software may have fewer cores left, as the number of cores in the common HPC pool will vary according to the use of other users. Therefore, the number of HPC core usage, which varies in the number of users using HPC cores, maybe due to this reason.\n\nN/A – Not Applicable\n\nConnection timed out while reading data To solve the Ansys Workbench ""Connection timed out while reading data"" error, you need to add ""cc.metu.edu.tr"" as DNS suffix in your network adapter settings for domain name resolution.

Answer:\n\nIn METU campus three (3) different brands of wireless access points are used. These are Aruba, Cisco and HP Procurve.\n\nAs can be understood from the drawing, the infrasturcture in METU uses WPA2 security standard. Besides this security solution, TTLS (PAP) is used to autenticate users in an easy way. In this structure the user needs only a certificate for EAPP, user certicicate is not used. The requent coming to the RADIUS server constitutes a mutual tunnel and the information that comes through this tunnel is analyzed by RADIUS and queried to LDAP over the secure network. If LDAP authenticates the user's username and password, the system accepts the user.\n\nLink: https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/what-technical-structure-eduroam\n\n\n\nEntry 2549\n\nQuestion: Who are the Türkiye eduroam members?

Answer:\n\nThe most important issue in eduroam is the security issue. In classical wireless networks, it's possible that someone can listen to the communication data. The only way to prevent this is to increase the complexity of the encryption method. Starting from the first moment you send your username and password, the communication is provided with encryption. Since the program for starting this TTLS algorithm is not present in Windows operation systems, we have to use a different program. If you are running Windows 10, this algorithm is builtin and you do not need to install a program.\n\nLink: https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/why-do-i-have-install-program-connecting-eduroam\n\n\n\nEntry 2551\n\nQuestion: How can I reach to department coordinator?

Answer:\n\nThe disk space allocated for user account owners on the central servers is designated as quota. Two different quota areas are allocated for METU users and their capacities are independent from each other. While it is possible to find about the latest state of both quotas with the Horde service, it is only possible to find out about the latest status of the file quota with terminal software like SSH and others. Displaying quota information with Horde Service: First, you must enter the Horde system by https://horde.metu.edu.tr address, then you must select the File Manager option under the left menu bar\'s ""My Account"" title. You can see both the file quota and the e-mail quota information by pressing the Check Quota button. Due to E-mail Quota applications, when quota limits are exceded, incoming e-mails can not be delivered to the receiver and will be returned to the sender. So that, it is important to use e-mail quotas within the limits. Displaying file quota information with Shell Client Programs (SSH etc.): Connect to your user account by using a terminal program like SSH and write the command quota on the command line. Click Enter to view the status of your file quota. The following screen will be displayed:\n\nOn this screen, you will see the following terms; blocks indicates the space you take up on your file quota in kilobytes, quota indicates the limit of your file quota in kilobytes, limit indicates the maximum amount that your file quota could get hold of in kilobytes, grace indicates the time that has remained from your grace period, files indicates the number of files available on your file quota.\n\nLink: https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/how-can-i-find-out-about-final-status-disk-space-and-my-quota-i-have-used\n\nEntry 2631\n\nQuestion: I am over quota, what should I do? Answer:\n\nThe disk space allocated for user account owners on the central servers is designated as quota. Two different quota areas are allocated for METU users, one for their files and one for their e-mail. The procedures to be followed are different when file or e-mail message quotas are full. For the e-mail messages quota: Another quota is designated for the disk area where the user keeps the e-mail messages. When 90% of this quota is full, an alert message is sent to the user. Due to E-mail Quota applications, when quota limits are exceded, incoming e-mails can not be delivered to the receiver and will be returned to the sender. So that, it is important to use e-mail quotas within the limits. When the e-mail messages quota is exceeded or near the upper limit, measures such as; deleting unnecessary and bulky e-mail messages, keeping the e-mail message attachments on the hard disk of the computer being used may be taken and the overload on the quota can be reduced. For the file quota: ""quota exceeded"" message tells you that, at present, you are using all of the disc space that is granted to you for the files on the server systems. Currently, the procedure allows a file quota of 100 MB to students and 250 MB to the personnel. You can display your disk usage and file quota with command quota If you draw near to your limit value, you may not be able to access to your account. Remember that Blocks value should not be higher than the Limit value. Otherwise you will receive ""quota exceed"" message. When you exceed the quota limits, the first thing you have to do is to find out the files with the largest sizes. You should either zip them or delete the unnecessary ones. Enter the following commands, to see the spaces used by each of your file; ls -l ls -l |more to zip your files; gzip\n\nto open the files that you have zipped;gunzip To change the directory you are in, enter this command;cd\n\nLink: https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/i-am-over-quota-what-should-i-do\n\nEntry 2632\n\nQuestion: What is the size of a user account quota? Answer:\n\nThe disk space allocated for user account owners on the central servers is designated as quota. Two different quota areas are allocated for METU users and their capacities are independent from each other. Depending on their status, METU users have the below indicated e-mail quota on the servers: Students: 250 MB METU Administrative Staff and Research Assistants: 750 MB METU Academic Staff : 1.5 GB When 90% of this quota is full, an alert message is sent to the user. Due to E-mail Quota applications, when quota limits are exceded, incoming e-mails can not be delivered to the receiver and will be returned to the sender. So that, it is important to use e-mail quotas within the limits. Depending on their status, METU users have the below indicated file quota on the servers: Students: 100 MB METU Staff: 250 MB Units within the EİS Project: 250 MB Student Groups: 250 MB Web users: 250 MB In compulsory cases you can apply for a file or e-mail quota increase by opening a support ticket via https://itsupport.metu.edu.tr and state the type of quota you want to increase and the reason for the increase request.\n\nLink: https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/what-size-user-account-quota\n\nEntry 2633\n\nQuestion: How can I change my password?

If you have problems with connecting to the VPN service, please check the following settings: Make sure that you have the version of Aruba VIA installed on your system is the same as the one available from https://netregister.metu.edu.tr . There may be an update to the version you are using. After downloading the new version, follow the steps at http://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/groups/vpn-service matching your operating system to setup Aruba VIA. If you end up with ""... has stopped working"" Windows error message when you try to run Aruba VIA software, there might be a problem with the software installation or a different problem with the operating system. For this problem, you can follow the resolutions suggested from this link. For each connection, you need to provide your usercode and password. If the Aruba VIA application does not ask for your usercode and password, please try clearing the profile of Aruba VIA. You can follow the steps at http://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/groups/vpn-service matching your operating system to setup Aruba VIA. Your network provider might be blocking the communication ports Aruba VIA needs to use. The ports Aruba VIA uses are 443 and 4500. (UDP: 500, 1701, 4500 TCP: 1723, 443, IP protocol: 50 are also used for MACOS) You can contact the IT department of your network provider to make sure that these ports are not blocked. Any antivirus or firewall applications installed on your computer might also block VPN connections or cause the application not to install. In such a case, please uninstall both the VPN and the antivirus/firewall applications and restart your computer. Then, you can try installing Aruba VPN. If you can establish the connection, you can install the antivirus after the VPN application.

Answer:\n\nThe disk space allocated for user account owners on the central servers is designated as quota. Two different quota areas are allocated for METU users, one for their files and one for their e-mail. The procedures to be followed are different when file or e-mail message quotas are full. For the e-mail messages quota: Another quota is designated for the disk area where the user keeps the e-mail messages. When 90% of this quota is full, an alert message is sent to the user. Due to E-mail Quota applications, when quota limits are exceded, incoming e-mails can not be delivered to the receiver and will be returned to the sender. So that, it is important to use e-mail quotas within the limits. When the e-mail messages quota is exceeded or near the upper limit, measures such as; deleting unnecessary and bulky e-mail messages, keeping the e-mail message attachments on the hard disk of the computer being used may be taken and the overload on the quota can be reduced. For the file quota: ""quota exceeded"" message tells you that, at present, you are using all of the disc space that is granted to you for the files on the server systems. Currently, the procedure allows a file quota of 100 MB to students and 250 MB to the personnel. You can display your disk usage and file quota with command quota If you draw near to your limit value, you may not be able to access to your account. Remember that Blocks value should not be higher than the Limit value. Otherwise you will receive ""quota exceed"" message. When you exceed the quota limits, the first thing you have to do is to find out the files with the largest sizes. You should either zip them or delete the unnecessary ones. Enter the following commands, to see the spaces used by each of your file; ls -l ls -l |more to zip your files; gzip\n\nto open the files that you have zipped;gunzip To change the directory you are in, enter this command;cd\n\nLink: https://faq.cc.metu.edu.tr/faq/i-am-over-quota-what-should-i-do\n\nEntry 2632\n\nQuestion: What is the size of a user account quota?

Course Description This is a reading and writing intensive seminar on human beings’ universal metabolic relationship with the rest of nature and the manifold historical-geographical forms this relationship takes. Moving from the European colonial expansion and the Caribbean transnationalism as a starting point of problematization, our discussion will often revolve broadly around the intersection of political economy and political ecology. We will critically discuss such issues as the relational and intersecting processes of appropriation of nature through human labor, the production of space and social ecologies; appropriation of labor’s surplus by the owners of the means of production; and the relational and transnational formation of social identities such as race, ethnicity, and gender through a historical perspective both in colonial and post-colonial contexts across the globe. Course Objectives:\n\nTo introduce and debate the relationality among the labor regimes, surplus extraction, land ownership systems and the construction of various social identities along different axes of social difference such as race, gender, ethnicity, and nationality. To problematize and discuss the differences between, imperialism, transnationalism, colonialism, post-colonialism, nationalism, and universalism through a historical materialist framework by specifically examining class formations, land ownership and labor regimes in the context of the emergence and consolidation of European political modernity. To discuss how above-mentioned processes are integral to the production of socio-ecological environments various peoples lived in and the historical formation of contemporary globalized political-ecological issues.\n\nCourse Requirements Attendance and Participation (20%) Attending the seminar: 1 point each week (14 Points in Total) Attending the discussion: 6 Points in total Inasmuch as you are free to come and go to our seminars as you like as free individuals, this course will evaluate your ability to bring your bodies and ideas into the classroom. There is a reason for such tyranny: The true gift of seminars is its collectivity, or what Marx calls “the natural advantages of cooperation” in the production process. It is in the classroom where we have a chance to express the way we read texts, hear others’ way of reading them, and challenge ourselves and our fellow readers in a fruitful collective environment. Honest intellectual engagement in class discussions is, after all, the most challenging demand this course will impose on you. Critical Discussion Leading (10%) Throughout the semester each of you will spin-off the in-class discussion with a presentation that should take 10-to-15-minutes. If the number of students exceed 13, this presentation can be done in pairs, in which case the two parts of the presentation should not exceed 20 minutes in total. You are expected to critically review the assignments of the week, lay down the main arguments and major points of discussion and put them into a dialogue with each other and the other texts of the syllabus whenever possible. Note that this excludes simple summaries. The primary aim of this exercise is to encourage you to construct a productive intellectual engagement with the assigned texts rather than being passive recipients. The experience from the past few semesters shows that it becomes very productive when you come up with critical questions derived from the text(s) to enrich your presentation. This enables us to pick up those questions to facilitate the discussion. When there are multiple texts in a particular week, you are expected to cover all the assigned readings and metabolize them in a single presentation. Note that the presentations that are unable to lay down the main arguments and crucial points of discussion in 15 minutes (20 if there are two presenters) and take longer are subject to point loss. It is an important skill to be able structure your talk in a time that is allocated to you, be it 5 minutes, 15 minutes or more. It is possible to identify the main arguments and major points of discussion of any text in 15 minutes, unless you try to summarize it. Reading Notes (21%) Throughout the semester you will write two-page response papers to seven weekly assignments of your choice. Each will account for 3% of your final grade. The principles of discussion leading applies to the notes as well. I would like you to critically discuss the assigned texts but given that you have two pages, you are encouraged to pick a point or two that you identify as interesting, important or vital for understanding the texts. You may again put these points into a dialogue with other texts of the course whenever possible. Note that this excludes simple summaries. The papers should be uploaded to turn-it-in until midnight on Tuesdays in order to facilitate the in-class discussion the next day. Since late papers would defeat this purpose, they will not be evaluated. You should come prepared to make those points and be able to defend them in the classroom when necessary. Term Paper (50%) You will submit a final paper at the end of the semester. Your term paper topic is entirely up to you, i.e., you can problematize any aspect of this course, as long as it inspires you, be it theoretical/conceptual or empirical. You can consult me anytime if you are not sure how your intended paper topic could address the debates covered throughout the semester. No matter what your topic is about, I expect you to construct your research topic, produce clear research questions, which will then determine the literature you will review in order to situate your paper and your arguments. This holistic and relational methodology/epistemology will be part of our discussions throughout the semester, which will help you with the construction of your paper. Your papers should be 15-20 pages. (Double-spaced, times new roman font, size 12.) Academic dishonesty and the expropriation of labor of others in any form will not be tolerated.

Answer: Middle East Technical University\'s Campus Technical Infrastructure is comprised of a number of departmental networks and various sizes of multi-user hosts connected around a campus-wide backbone network. At the core of campus technical infrastructure, there is this backbone network which is referred as ""METU-NET Backbone"". METU-NET has been installed in 1990 with 16 connection points, and expanded to 79 connection points in 2009. The previous Token ring backbone technology is cancelled in 2000 and a new infrastructure based on ATM technology was installed. This backbone was used till 2004 when the new back backbone based on gigabit ethernet technology took its place. Currently, all departments in the campus are connected to the new Gigabit Ethernet Backbone. Since 2011, METU-NET is supported with 10 Gigabit Ethernet technology. Each departmental network is comprised of a collection of multi-user and/or single user systems that are connected to a departmental Local Area Network. This departmental LAN is in turn connected to the backbone via ethernet switches with Gigabit uplinks. METU Computer Center (METU CC) has the full responsibility and control over the backbone network (METU-NET). Departments\' technical staff operates departmental LANs and METU CC provides technical consultation upon request. You can see the list of department administrative/technical coordinators from this link. The communication on the campus infrastructure is based technically on Internet Protocol (IP). Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. METU-NET provides its Internet connetion through TUBITAK\'s (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye) ULAKNET (Turkish Academic Network and Information Center). Main Campus\' connection to ULAKNET has 10 Gbps capacity. ULAKNET provides a high bandwidth capacity for the main campus and its distant units\' (METU Northern Cyprus Campus and Mersin Erdemli Insitute of Marine Sciences) Internet connection. Mersin Erdemli Institute of Marine Sciences which is not a part of the main campus is connected to METU-NET with a high bandwidth capacity. Likewise, Northern Cyprus Campus is connected to METU-NET with a high bandwith capacity. Beside this connection, a spare connection of 1 Gbps capacity is kept ready to be used in case of a problem. Information about the condition and statistics of off the campus Internet connection can be obtained through http://lines.metu.edu.tr() () This links can be accessed only in METU Campus.

The first part of the course deals with the basics, which includes an engagement with the foundational concepts of the IR discipline as well as the concept of “theory” itself. In the second part of the course, we discuss the major paradigms –a concept you will become familiar with in this course– of IR. Paradigms for our purposes refer to the totality of assumptions, thought patterns, theories, research questions, methods, and programs pertaining to a collectively imagined framing of the social world. Part III examines the important omissions. Many of the major paradigms proceed from a structural understanding of world politics that focus on the interactions of states. They tend not to engage with deeper issues of world politics such as its main constituent actors like the state. We need to grapple with the nexus of system and unit-level phenomena by situating the state historically and among major IR theories. Next, we assess the state of knowledge production the discipline, focusing not only on the relative neglect of non-Western approaches to IR but also by problematizing the omission of gender as a significant factor in world politics. We will end the course by discussing the future of the international order via an appraisal/critique of contemporary U.S. foreign policy. At this point, students will be well placed to excel in their final take-home exam. The final, Part IV, looks at contemporary, critical and emancipatory aspects of IR Theory by scrutinizing the constituent elements of the social world and the power dynamics therein.

While the course primarily focuses on the foundational concepts and paradigms of international relations, it also critiques the neglect of non-Western approaches and the omission of gender as a significant factor in world politics. This critical approach can be extended to environmental awareness by encouraging students to think about the power dynamics and hierarchies that exist in the social world, which are often intertwined with environmental issues. Thus, while not explicitly focused on environmental awareness, the course's critical examination of international relations can lead to discussions about the environmental implications of state interactions and policies.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

The Office of Dormitories, with the aim of solving our students' accommodation issues by offering a high standard service, obtained TSE-EN ISO 9001-2000 certificate of quality from the Turkish Standards Institution (TSE) in 2005. Regarding the quality of our dormitory services, the inspections carried out in 2021 in accordance with the TSE-EN ISO 9001:2015 standards were completed with success. The services provided by our unit are carried out according to the procedures, instructions, duties, and responsibilities determined within the Dormitory Regulations, Student Discipline Regulations of the higher education institutions, decisions taken by the Executive Board of Dormitories, and the certificates of quality. Therefore, every year, the Executive Board of Dormitories evaluates the dormitory applications of students based on the current capacity of dormitories, the number of applications, and the conditions for staying in the dormitories established in accordance with the aforementioned regulations and approved by the Rectorate. Then, the registration procedures of the students whose applications are accepted are conducted. We endeavor to provide 24/7 uninterrupted service that includes an environment of respect, love, equality and trust in our dormitories with an understanding that prioritizes a service that is high-quality, transparent, modern but at the same time adherent to the traditions of METU, which can only be achieved with a team spirit.\n\nEntry 2\n\n\n\nFacilities in the Dormitories: There is a mini-fridge in each room.

In addition, the dormitory offers students a bedding set consisting of bed sheet, blanket and pillow. Students can also bring and use their own bedding sets if they prefer to do so (but in this case, washing and cleaning these bedding sets will be their responsibility). In our dormitories, there are common studying rooms, TV rooms, laundry rooms, and kitchens as well as another common room for students of the Department of Architecture so that they can carry out their activities such as drawing. A sufficient number of automatic washing machines, dryers, irons, and ironing boards are available to students in the laundry rooms. The bedding sets in the room are changed periodically, but if need be, they can be changed outside their regular cycle as well.

Introduce students to the research in environmental sociology and to emphasize how a sociological perspective can inform our understanding of changes in the natural world. Although environmental sociology encompasses a large and growing literature, the course will focus upon several prominent works and will introduce students to the fundamental issues and debates in the field. Promote students’ ability to evaluate the existing research and to understand its implications. Class discussions, lectures, writing assignments, and the final paper will all help in the realization of this goal. Promote the development of a global perspective on environmental issues. Just as processes of environmental and social change are linked, developments originating in isolated regions often have worldwide implications. Conversely, global trends are often particularly manifest in specific locales. This course will attempt to make those critical connections evident. Enhance students’ writing and research abilities. Toward this end, each student in the course will complete regular writing assignments and a research paper.\n\nEnvironmental sociology is a field of inguiry that focuses on the relationship between society and the biophysical environment.

This course examines and compares cultures through materials and practices embedded in everyday life with anthropological perspectives. One of the most important subjects of everyday life is food. Food is more than sustenance; it is our lifestyle, a nexus among people, it brings memories and nostalgia. Through food we create and present our identities (e.g., national, regional, religious, ethnic, gender and class); for example, tamales are significant food among Mexicans and South Americans. Does it follow that the consumption of tamales signifies regionalism or nationalism? Are all pizza Italian? Is pizza served at American franchised restaurants Italian or American cuisine? Is barbeque for men more than for women and sweets for women more than men? How do people feel nostalgic for foreign originated food? Do people consume no meat for good health or for political statement? The relationships between food and people are complex. And, it is an individual researcher’s goal to discover, analyze and interpret the complexity. By exploring foodways—the traditions and customs in production, consumption and distribution of food—of others and ours, we will learn the different ways of using food to create and present identities; how and in what circumstances people use food to distinguish them from one another as well as connect with others? How do they recreate new identities or diminish old ones in order to be accepted in new places or by new people? The primary goal of this course is to develop a critical awareness of cultural similarities as much as differences. Throughout the course, you should always ask yourself: What is culture? We study food as an academic subject through readings, films and class/group discussions. There are no right and wrong opinions as each of us have a different background, which has shaped our perspectives. However, you should be thinking about food in terms of anthropology. As a final project, you will do a food-based research paper—to examine food of other culture rather than your own, such as outside your region, ethnicity, religion, class, and gender. In your paper, you should pose a central research question, for example, “How do people in America present their class identity through sushi consumption?” or “How is simit significant to everyday life in Turkey?” By examining the ways by which others shape their identity through food, you learn about their culture and people. This helps you to be self-reflective with your own culture as well. In your research paper, you should discuss how a particular food impacts people’s everyday life and the ways by which they form their identities.\n\nThe course probes such social and cultural questions as ´Are there different kinds of rationality? ´, ´Does language limit and control thought? ´, ´What kind of difficulties arise when we attempt to translate from one language, or culture, into another?, ´Are there universal moral principles? ´, ´Is it possible to compare different cultures? ´ Basic concepts such as self, reason and sanity, money and wealth, religious beliefs, and health will be subjected to critique.\n\nCourse Link: https://catalog.metu.edu.tr/course.php?prog=232&course_code=2320417\n\n']","Food is more than sustenance; it is a lifestyle and a nexus among people, bringing memories and nostalgia.
