Here are a few courses that might interest you:\n\n1. **ARCH204**: This course is specifically designed to introduce students to the concepts of BIM. You'll gain knowledge on modeling tools, analysis of buildings, planning of construction, and development of two- and three-dimensional design representations.\n2. **ARCH351**: In this course, you'll learn about architectural detailing, professional architectural drafting, and implementation of BIM. You'll understand the theory, techniques, methodologies, and tools for architectural detailing, as well as orthogonal architectural representation for on-site construction.\n\nBoth courses will provide you with a solid foundation in BIM, which is an essential tool in modern architecture. These courses are designed to help you develop skills in modeling information for construction, analysis of buildings, and planning of construction projects.\n\nAdditionally, you might also be interested in **ARCH371**, which focuses on Information Architecture and the methods of organizing information. While not directly related to BIM, this course will help you understand how to interpret complex data and make informed decisions in your architectural practice.\n\nI hope this helps!

      "content": "Connecting to Meturoam is a straightforward process, but it does require some specific settings on your device. To get started, make sure your device supports WPA2 Enterprise with PEAP/MSCHAPv2. You can check if your device is compatible by looking at the list of devices that are known to work or not work on the Meturoam network.\n\nTo connect to Meturoam, you'll need a METU usercode and password for the service. If you already have a password, you can skip to the HOW-TO section below. If you didn't create a password or want to renew it, visit https://netregister.metu.edu.tr and click on the Wireless icon, then select \"meturoam\" from the menu.\n\nHere's what you need to do:\n\n1. Connect to the Meturoam SSID (wireless network) on your device.\n2. Open a web browser and go to https://netregister.metu.edu.tr.\n3. Click on the Wireless icon and select \"meturoam\" from the menu.\n4. Enter your METU usercode and create a new password for meturoam.\n5. Make sure to use your usercode in the format e123456@metu.edu.tr (not your email alias).\n6. If you're using Windows 10, the protocol settings will be done automatically. For Linux or Windows 7 and below, select WPA2-Enterprise and AES.\n7. In mobile devices, be careful not to add a blank space at the end of your usercode.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or are asked for a certificate, you can try selecting \"Do not validate\" and skipping it. Some Android devices may require you to enter a certificate, so be prepared for that.\n\nThat's it! If you have any further questions or need help with the process, feel free to ask.",

This way, you'll be showcasing your proficiency in English and giving yourself a competitive edge.\n\nOn the other hand, if you don't have an English exam score, that's okay too! Admitted students who don't submit a valid TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE ACADEMIC score during registration can take METU's own English Proficiency Exam (ODT\u00dc EPE).
